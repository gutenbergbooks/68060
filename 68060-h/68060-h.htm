<p>From time to time in the Doubleday Short Studies in Political Science
series, guest analysts from outside the formal boundaries of the discipline
will be invited to help fill certain gaps in existing materials. In the present
instance a young professional student of literature, Dr. Joseph Blotner, has
contributed a much-needed and highly useful introduction to the political
novel. Thanks largely to the care and skill with which this analysis has been
prepared, students of English and political science, as well as general readers,
should find new and stimulating pathways open to them.</p>

<p>So far as the editor and author know, this is the first essay of its kind in
the English language. The fact is worth noting because, despite the large
number of political novels in all languages and despite the obvious importance
of this particular species of the novel generally, scholars in the
field of literature have not devoted systematic attention to it. Until Dr.
Blotner decided to undertake a full-scale investigation of the political novel&mdash;of
which the present essay is one of the beginning steps&mdash;the teacher of
political science could search the modern language journals and literary
periodicals in vain for help in canvassing the possibly valuable contributions
of the novelist in describing and explaining political behavior.</p>

<p><em>The Political Novel</em> is to be welcomed on still other grounds. It is interdisciplinary
in scope and intent and it demonstrates anew the fruitful
results which can be achieved when a scholar merges his technical competence
in one branch of learning with his informed and enthusiastic interest
in another. Moreover, crude and scattered though the bridges between
pairs of the social sciences (e.g., political psychology) are, the bridges between
the social sciences and the humanities are even more so. Collaboration&mdash;in
this case between literature and political science&mdash;should certainly
take more than one form, but whatever the form, the great need is to light
up the shadowy twilight zones which lie between major disciplines. Not
only are these unexplored areas of subject matter to be charted, there are
common purposes and joint efforts to be considered. Among others, Dr.
Blotner has raised the question: what can the experts in literature and in
politics give to each other?</p>

<p>The analysis of the political novel set forth in these pages makes a variety
of contributions to learning. Novels can be read two ways: for pleasure and
for profit. The latter object&mdash;as in all academic subjects&mdash;is sometimes
pursued under conditions which deny the former. Nonetheless, the reader
is reminded by Dr. Blotner that to be alerted beforehand to the nature and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
significance of this type of novel is to combine pleasure with an awareness
that the content may be very revealing of data concerning political life.
Thus the words of a writer are at once pleasure-giving and instructive&mdash;<em>if</em>
the reader is looking out for the proper clues. Second, there is made available
an original classification of political novels and politically relevant summaries
to serve as a guide to political scientists. The bibliography, though
selected, is especially useful in this respect. Third, the headings and substance
of Chapters Two to Six actually provide a set of analytical functions
which the author believes the novel may serve in illuminating major aspects
of politics and government. This study is so cast that the transition from
thinking about novels to thinking about politics is painless and without
distortion. No one having any familiarity with the traditional categories of
political science will find Dr. Blotner’s own presentation strange or unsophisticated.</p>

<p>In addition, this essay represents an attempt to establish durable intellectual
bases for probing the nature of the political novel. The tentative
definitions and criteria of identification, classification of functions, and
annotations are a substantial move in this direction. Finally, among the
data revealed in the contents of political novels is evidence of the way a
given society reacts to its own political institutions and practices. To the
extent that such novels partially yet accurately reflect social reality, the
student of politics can draw valid inferences concerning the political beliefs&mdash;including
beliefs about the nature of politics&mdash;held by a sizeable portion
of the society’s membership at any one time. One can detect at least the
broad outlines of periodic shifts in the political concerns of a people or any
segment thereof in their literature.</p>

<p>Chapter One discusses some problems arising from a study of the political
novel. This is an important chapter and contains some homely
wisdom on the different approaches respectively of the novelist and the
political scientist. It should be stressed that certain crucial points with respect
to the analysis of human behavior in general can be raised by comparing
the techniques of the two kinds of observers and reporters. The
well-known remark about pictures being worth thousands of words has
occasionally been transposed to the effect that one good story is worth a
whole (and dry) textbook. This, of course, is an attractive argument. But it
does raise the fundamental question of what analytical operations are performed
by the novelist on the one hand and the political scientist on the
other. Offhand it would seem as though there were important differences
carrying beyond those of purposes discussed by the author. Generally
speaking, the novelist is primarily concerned with a coherent story, with a
whole fabric of description, and with specific details while the political
scientist is concerned with events, processes, and factors, with abstractions
from wholes and with classes of general phenomena. The latter builds upon
numerous instances, upon gross data, and upon repeated patterns of behavior.
The former builds upon an amassing of individualized data fashioned
into a unique chronicle. The one gains richness and sacrifices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
capacity to generalize, the other sacrifices detail for broad generalization.
For the novelist, Uncle Tom becomes a microcosm, a device for revealing
the tragedy of the whole Negro race in America through a portrait of a
single character. For the political scientist, Uncle Tom is lost in what can
be said of the entire group of which he is a member. Both are limited and
both pay a price accordingly. Clearly more is involved in the different
analytic techniques but it suffices to indicate one type of issue raised in
this study of the political novel.</p>

<p>Other issues are equally noteworthy. The main character in a novel may
be likened to a dummy&mdash;or a model&mdash;created by the author for the purposes
of expressing the author’s observations and, in effect, for “playing out” his
ideas. Though the character is pure fiction&mdash;i.e., any similarities to known
real persons are coincidental&mdash;an effective novel must have believable characters,
recognizable through behavior traits identified by readers from their
own everyday experience. So too the social scientist uses models&mdash;analytic
dummies&mdash;to further his purposes. Dissecting the anatomy of a political
model and putting its characters under close examination can teach something
about the most fruitful relationships between real persons and fictional
characters for purposes of describing and explaining behavior. Often the
fact that the novelist is actually building models is obscured by the amount
of detail he pours into his molds which then makes his models seem remarkably
lifelike. While the models of the social scientist are usually much
further removed from correspondence to real persons, the properties built
into them must be “believable” too.</p>

<p>Another area of inquiry can be opened up if one accepts the cues offered
by Dr. Blotner’s selections and analyses. Political novels seem to reflect
mostly the seamy side of political life, emphasizing conflict as the sole
theme meriting attention. Through their characters, authors seem to place
great blame for social ills on political institutions as detached from other
institutions or on individual devils. Is this a reliable and full revelation of
politics? As a matter of fact, novels too seem caught in two opposite kinds
of explanations: the great man and the great historical force. Each has
significant limitations and accompanying fallacies yet each assumes great
plausibility at the hands of a skillful storyteller. Inevitably the novelist
dramatizes, and in real life the political actor dramatizes too. Unfortunately,
the tendency to dramatize reinforces the neglect of the mundane factors
which often influence crucial political action and choice.</p>

<p>This line of thought suggests certain concrete exercises which might be
profitable for the student of politics to undertake. Since the search for
fruitful hypotheses is a backbone of any systematic discipline, it might be
useful to search these novels to see if any have been missed. A corollary
effort would be to check the knowledge of politics exhibited in political
novels against the latest agreements among political scientists. Still another
effort might be directed toward a content analysis (in the technical sense)
of the novel as medium of communication in order to throw light on the
value structure of the society or individuals which are depicted. Finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
what aspects of politics have been ignored by novelists and why? For example,
a novel might be an excellent way to illuminate the world of the
decision-maker, the governor, the leader. Thus far, none has really done so.</p>

<p>Dr. Blotner is to be congratulated for aiding an important cause: the
use of novels as a teaching device in political science courses. Those who
have tried have been rewarded but have lacked an introductory essay and
bibliographical guidance. Novels make points which can be made in no
other way and in interesting fashion. The student’s idea of the political
realm and of approaches to its understanding will be enlarged by following
the thoughtful guide presented below.</p>

<p>One considerable merit of this monograph is a lighter style than is
normally characteristic of political science literature. Nonetheless, its intellectual
quality will make the reader anticipate Dr. Blotner’s larger study.</p>

The Study of the Political Novel</h2>
</div>

<h3>The Importance of the Political Novel</h3>

<p>In an age in which progressively more men have engaged in politics
while the politics themselves have become increasingly complex, any means
for understanding these interrelated phenomena becomes correspondingly
more valuable. The techniques of science are constantly being brought to
bear upon this problem of understanding. But one of the best means of
enlightenment has been available for more than a hundred years. Since its
beginning the political novel has fulfilled the ancient function of art. It has
described and interpreted human experience, selectively taking the facts of
existence and imposing order and form upon them in an aesthetic pattern
to make them meaningful. The political novel is important to the student
of literature as one aspect of the art of fiction, just as is the psychological
novel or the economic novel. But it is important in a larger context, too.
The reader who wants a vivid record of past events, an insight into the
nature of political beings, or a prediction of what lies ahead can find it in
the political novel. As an art form and an analytical instrument, the political
novel, now as ever before, offers the reader a means for understanding
important aspects of the complex society in which he lives, as well as a
record of how it evolved.</p>


<h3>The Nature of the Political Novel: Problems of Definition and
Selection</h3>

<p>The political novel is hard to define. To confine it to activity in the
houses of Congress or Parliament is to look at the top floor of the political
structure and to ignore the main floor and basement which support it. One
has to follow the novelist’s characters, on the stump and into committee
rooms&mdash;sometimes even farther. But the line is drawn where the political
element is forced into the background by the sociological or economic. The
political milieu develops in part out of the conditions described in Upton
Sinclair’s <em>The Jungle</em> and John Steinbeck’s <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. Although
these books are proletarian novels, to include them would be to open the
door to a flood of books that would spread far beyond the space limitations
of this study. Of course, proletarian novels which are also political novels
are included. Two such books are André Malraux’s <em>Man’s Fate</em> and Steinbeck’s
<em>In Dubious Battle</em>. But for the purposes of this study, a cast of characters
drawn from the proletariat is not enough, even if they are oppressed
economically and socially. They must carry out political acts or move in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
political environment. Also excluded are novels such as Herman Melville’s
<em>Mardi</em> which treat politics allegorically or symbolically. Here a political
novel is taken to mean a book which directly describes, interprets, or
analyzes political phenomena.</p>

<p>Our prime material is the politician at work: legislating, campaigning,
mending political fences, building his career. Also relevant are the people
who influence him: his parents, his wife, his mistress, the girl who jilted
him, the lobbyist who courted his favor. The primary criterion for admission
of a novel to this group was the portrayal of political acts, so many of
them that they formed the novel’s main theme or, in some cases, a major
theme. These acts are not always obvious ones like legislating. In Joseph
Conrad’s <em>Nostromo</em> a mine owner contributes financial support to political
movements which will provide a more favorable climate for his business.
<em>In Dubious Battle</em> presents labor organizers who manipulate a strike to
serve the political ends of the Communist Party. The terminology of the
theater can be helpful in bridging the gap between the world of actual
events and the world of fiction. It helps to show how various aspects of the
actual political process are translated into the forms of fiction. The author
may concentrate his attention upon the actors&mdash;the public officials who
make decisions and wield authority on behalf of the community or the
whole society. A good many of the actors may not be public officials, but
rather private citizens whose acts are political: voicing opinions, helping to
select candidates, voting, attempting to influence the political process, revolting.
These actors, and those who are public officials, may demonstrate
factors in the overall drama which are predominantly political in their
consequences: attitudes, social power, social stratification. The novelist
will be concerned with the roles the actors play and the lines they speak,
the purposes they have and the strategies they employ. He may concentrate
upon the interaction between these actors or between them and the audience&mdash;the
public. An author may choose to emphasize the drama as a whole
rather than the individual actors, highlighting the stage upon which it is
played out&mdash;the country or area of national life in which the scenes are
laid. This emphasis upon the drama will throw into sharp relief the events
and decisions in which the actors participate, and the framework of rules
or custom against which they take place.</p>

<p>The novels considered here deal with political activity at all levels&mdash;local,
state, national, and international. If, as von Clausewitz said, “War
is merely the continuation of Politics by other means,” one may find
politics in war, too. This study, therefore, includes works on revolutionary
as well as parliamentary politics. On the international level especially one
encounters group attitudes which are politically relevant. The groups may
be the conventional social, economic, or political strata of British and
American society, or they may be those of the rigid Marxist state. Other
relevant attitudes spring from national characteristics, and many political
novels identify some of them. This definition is wide and inclusive, but so
is political activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>The primary sources of this study are eighty-one political novels. Over
half of them are by Americans. The next largest group is the work of English
writers. Other novels are taken from Italian, French, German, Russian,
and South African literature. These eighty-one novels are the minimum
necessary to give an understanding of the political novel. At the same time,
this is the maximum number that could be included in the study. Only in
the case of the English and American political novel has an attempt been
made to trace the development of literary genre. Some of these novels are
used because they show artistic excellence, others because they show how
the form developed historically. More American than English novels are
used because they are more readily available, many of them in inexpensive,
paper-bound editions. It was not possible to attempt the same outline with
the other literatures because of the brevity of this study. For some of them,
too, a sufficiently representative group of political novels was not available.</p>

<p>Most often the authors deal with their own countries, although they
sometimes write about a foreign land. Some of them are hard to pigeonhole:
Henry James, an American expatriate writing about London terrorists
in <em>The Princess Casamassima</em>; Joseph Conrad, an Anglicized Pole analyzing
Russian revolutionaries in <em>Under Western Eyes</em>; Arthur Koestler, an
Austrian-educated Hungarian living in France, describing the Moscow
trials in <em>Darkness at Noon</em>. This is one reason why it is more fruitful for
present purposes to avoid strict concentration on national literatures and to
accept valid insights into national characteristics and behavior patterns no
matter what the language of their source.</p>


<h3>Characteristics of the Political Novel</h3>

<p>In <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> the witty and urbane Stendhal says,
“Politics in a work of literature are like a pistol-shot in the middle of a
concert, something loud and vulgar yet a thing to which it is not possible to
refuse one’s attention.” His own work contradicts the great French novelist,
yet his comment is perfectly accurate for many other novelists. Politics in
some modern novels of political corruption, such as Charles F. Coe’s <em>Ashes</em>,
do seem loud and vulgar, and in books like Upton Sinclair’s the reader may
hear not one pistol shot but a cannonade. But this is not to say that the
use of political material must disrupt a work of literature. The trick, of
course, is all in knowing how. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote an artistically
weak, politically successful work in <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, while Fyodor
Dostoyevsky produced a politically unsuccessful, artistically enduring classic
in <em>The Possessed</em>.</p>

<p>The quality of these novels varies widely, just as would that of a group
dealing with religion, sex, or any other complex, controversial theme. In
general, the European novels considered here attain a higher level than the
American books. This is partly because only the better European novels are
treated. But they are also superior to the best American works, except for
a few comparatively recent ones, because of the wider variety of political
experience presented, the greater concern with ideology and theory, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the deeper insight into individual motivation and behavior. This in turn is
probably due to several factors. From the time when the United States attained
its independence until the end of the first quarter of this century, it
possessed a relatively stable set of doctrines and frames of reference (compared
to those existing in Europe) within which the individual led his
political life. Although American parties rose and declined, although the
Union was preserved, its borders expanded, and international responsibility
accepted, this evolution was orderly and limited compared to that which
occurred in Europe. The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution,
and the Bill of Rights provided a stable yet sufficiently flexible political
framework. Europe during the same period reverberated with the French
Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the unification of Germany and Italy,
and the Russian Revolution. These were violent changes not only in theory
but in the actual form of government. It is not unnatural then that American
political novels range over a relatively narrower area, with their main
emphasis on local or national subjects, while those of European authors
delineate changing, conflicting, and radically different ideologies and
resultant events. It is only since the 1930s, with the increase in centralized
government, the impact of international Communism, and the recent appearance
on both the Right and the Left of what seem to be threats to
traditional American freedoms, that the American political novel has begun
to approach the European in breadth of theme, concern with political
theory, and interpretation of varying political behavior patterns.</p>

<p>The larger number of bad novels in the American group is also due to
the fact that more American novels are treated. Because of their greater
availability both for research and teaching, it is possible to show the evolution
of this genre in the United States. In doing this one is able to examine
the good ones, old and new, such as Henry Adams’ <em>Democracy</em>, John Dos
Passos’ <em>District of Columbia</em> trilogy, and Irwin Shaw’s <em>The Troubled Air</em>.
One pays, however, by suffering through period pieces such as F. Marion
Crawford’s <em>An American Politician</em>. Less obtuse politically but nearly as
abysmal artistically, is Paul Leicester Ford’s <em>The Honorable Peter Stirling</em>.
One is compensated, however, not only by the view of a developing genre,
but also by the recording of significant periods in American national life
and of the people who helped shape it, as in the Dos Passos work, and by
the sensitive and penetrating analysis of central problems in contemporary
life, as in Shaw’s novel.</p>

<p>The English political novel is also uneven. That its depths are not so low
as those in the American novel is due in part to the political heritage which
its authors share with their colleagues on the continent. Its authors work
from a long and rich political history in which the evolution has been less
violent but no less steady.</p>


<h3>The Novelist and the Political Scientist</h3>

<p>The differences between the methods of the political novelist and the
political scientist are worth studying. Their intentions are often at variance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Whereas the scientist is dedicated to objectivity and statistical accuracy,
the novelist is often consciously subjective; if his work is intended as a
political instrument, as were <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> and <em>The Possessed</em>,
scrupulous attention to the claims of the other side will invariably lessen
the emotional impact and political worth of the novel. If a scholar sets out
to examine the rise of Nazism, he will have to treat not only the Beer Hall
Putsch and the Reichstag fire, but German history and the German national
character as well. He will chronicle the effects of Versailles, the staggering
of the Weimar Republic, and the growing strength of the Brown Shirts. He
will be concerned with national attitudes, with the relative strength of the
parties that vied with the National Socialists. His study will gauge the
effects of the aging Hindenburg and the demoniac Hitler on a people
smarting from defeat, searching for a scapegoat, and longing for a resurgence.
And all this will be backed with statistics where possible. It will
be a cogently reasoned analysis with documented references to available
sources. Also, the study will be aimed at a fairly homogeneous and well-defined
audience. The appeal will be intellectual. If emotion creeps in, the
work is probably bad.</p>

<p>The novelist who is to examine these same events will present them quite
differently, even apart from the techniques of fiction. If he is a rather dispassionate
chronicler of human foibles and frailties such as, say, Somerset
Maugham, he will probably portray a group of people through whose actions
the rise and significance of Nazism will become meaningful. The
reader will probably observe the drifting war veteran, the hard-pressed
workman, the anxious demagogue. Out of these lives and their interactions
will emerge an objective study of the sources of a political movement and of
the shape it took. If the novelist is an enthusiastic Nazi, the book will
reflect his particular bias. The storm troopers will become heroic Horst
Wessels, the young women stalwart Valkyries, the Führer an inspired
prophet and leader. Out of the novel will come a plea for understanding
or a justification of violence and a perverted view of German national
destiny. The book will be emotionally charged, a calculated effort to produce
a specific desired response. If this series of historical events is used by
a Frenchman, they will undergo another change. There will probably be an
evocation of the Junker mentality, of Prussian militarism, of hordes of gray-green
figures under coal-scuttle helmets. If this novel is not a call to arms,
it will be a warning cry to signal a growing danger. These three fictional
books will use the same staples of the novelist’s art, yet each will differ
from the others in motivation and attitude. They will portray aspects of the
same complex of events treated by the political scientist, but this will be
virtually their only similarity.</p>

<p>A disadvantage for the novelist is his need to make his book appealing
enough to sell and to make his reader want to buy his next novel. Although
the scientist too must make his work as polished and interesting as he can,
the novelist does not, like him, find his readers among subscribers to the
learned journals. He cannot rely upon sales prompted by the need to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
abreast of research in a specialized field. If a novelist is to stay in print,
political savoir-faire and intellectual capacity are not enough. He has to sell
copies. Perhaps this is one reason why all but a few of these novels have a
love story accompanying the political theme. Sometimes the love story
inundates it, as in <em>An American Politician</em>; in other novels, such as Sinclair’s
<em>Presidential Agent</em>, it is peripheral and pieced out with flirtations. It may
be that these novelists include this element because love is as much a part
of life as politics. Its nearly universal presence is a reminder, however, of
one aspect of the novelist’s task and one way in which his work differs considerably
from that of the political scientist.</p>

<p>The advantages of the novelist’s method over the political scientist’s
compensate for the drawbacks. These advantages do not necessarily produce
a better work, one which gives more insight into a problem or explains it
better. They do, however, offer more latitude and fewer restrictions. The
novelist may use all the techniques of the political scientist. Sinclair’s
Boston is studded with as many references to actual events, people, and
documents as most scientific studies, although it is permeated by a violent
partisanship which would make a scholarly study highly suspect. But this
points up one of the novelist’s advantages: he can use the methods of
scholarship to document his case and then supplement them with heroes
and villains who add an emotional appeal to the intellectual one. This string
to the novelist’s bow is a strong one. He can create a character like Shaw’s
Clement Archer in <em>The Troubled Air</em>, while the scientist is forced to use
opinion research, carefully documented sources, and well-verified trends in
treating the problem of deprivation of livelihood as a penalty for suspected
political unreliability. Sometimes the scientist uses case histories, but the
subjects are often identified by initials and treated with such antiseptic objectivity
that almost no emotional impact comes through. The loss of
Clement Archer’s job, because he has employed actors blacklisted for suspected
Communist activity by a newsletter acting as a self-appointed judge,
presents this general problem with more frightening immediacy and reader-involvement
than an excellent scholarly study could ever do. Archer becomes
one embodiment of the problem&mdash;a rather naïve but courageous
liberal made into a sacrificial goat because of his fight for what he believes
to be traditional and critical American rights. If he wants to, the novelist
can use historical personages to flesh out his story. Although the reader does
not see him in its pages, Dos Passos’ <em>The Grand Design</em> uses the figure of
Franklin D. Roosevelt in the background as one of the mainsprings of the
action. An individual may appear in transparent fictional guise. The <em>roman
à clef</em> has many representatives in the political novel. Pyotr Verhovensky
in Dostoyevsky’s <em>The Possessed</em> has been identified as the revolutionary
Sergei Nechaev. Hamer Shawcross in Howard Spring’s <em>Fame Is the Spur</em>
is thought to be Ramsay MacDonald. The governor-dictators who rampage
through Dos Passos’ <em>Number One</em>, Adria Langley’s <em>A Lion Is in the
Streets</em>, and Robert Penn Warren’s <em>All the King’s Men</em> look and act
much like Huey Long. The novelist ranges backward into time as does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the scientist. Maugham’s <em>Then and Now</em> brings to life the wily Niccolo
Machiavelli, and Samuel Shellabarger’s <em>Prince of Foxes</em> reexamines the
sinister Cesare Borgia. When the novelist goes forward into time he
need not be confined to a mathematical extrapolation of birth rates,
trade balances, or electoral trends. Instead, he can create, whole and
entire, the world which he thinks will grow out of the one in which he
lives or which he sees emerging. The scientist may attempt to define the
group mind or examine pressures toward enforced conformity in political
thought. But George Orwell in <em>1984</em> creates his own terrifying vision of
the world thirty years from now. And this story is frighteningly believable.
It does not even require Coleridge’s “willing suspension of disbelief which
constitutes poetic faith.” With its three super states perpetually at war, its
Newspeak vocabulary including “thoughtcrime” and “doublethink,” its
omnipresent Big Brother, 1984 reflects aspects of our world out of which
the novelist’s vision grew. Besides the political apparatus which Orwell
builds, he creates a protagonist, Winston Smith, one man out of all the
masses of Party members and Proles who revolts against the system, providing
the reader with a focus for personal association. The reader follows
him through his round of duties in the Ministry of Truth, into his state-forbidden
love affair, and finally down into the depths of the Ministry of
Love where he is tortured into conformity before he will be “vaporized”
and poured into the stratosphere as gas. If he likes, the author can move at
will seven centuries into the future, where Aldous Huxley erected his <em>Brave
New World</em>. From a world of mechanization, deteriorating family ties, and
ascendant pragmatic science, he can artistically extrapolate a planet ruled
cooperatively by ten World Controllers. Embryos are conditioned within
their glass flasks and then decanted into a rigidly stratified society where
stability has outlawed change and Ford has replaced God. And there are
memorable people&mdash;sensuous Lenina Crowne, and the Savage, a “natural
man” who commits suicide rather than choose between prehistoric primitivism
and soulless modernism.</p>

<p>Not only does the novelist have complete freedom in time and space,
he has the right to use any of the devices found attractive in communication
since the first articulate primate squatting in the firelight gave his interpretation
of experience to his hairy brothers. The point of the story can be
driven home or made more palatable with laughter, suspense, or a cops-and-robbers
chase that will make it memorable. Ernest Hemingway’s Spanish
guerrillas and Ignazio Silone’s Italian peasants are often amusing. The
reader may remember the inspired profanity or the droll proverbs; he will
also remember the fight against Fascism and oppression. From <em>Darkness at
Noon</em> the reader will take with him Rubashov’s midnight arrest, the wait
for the NKVD bullet in the back of the neck; he will retain, too, the irony
of the disillusioned Bolshevik destroyed by the monster he helped create.</p>

<p>This attempt to differentiate the novelist’s approach from the scientist’s
is not meant to prove that the novelist’s is better. It is simply different,
representing another aspect of the difference between science and art. Each
discipline tries to describe and interpret experience. Where one does it by
means of well-defined, rigidly controlled techniques within generally accepted
boundaries, the other is highly flexible, embodying a view of life
shaped by an individual set of preferences and dislikes, talents and blind
spots. Each of these divergent methods offers advantages and disadvantages.
One should not go to political novels expecting to find, except in rare cases,
complete objectivity, solidly documented references, and exhaustive expositions
of political theory. He should not always anticipate credibility. When
problems are presented, the reader may not find answers or even indications
of the directions in which they may be found. But one cannot go to a
scientific monograph with the hope of meeting in its pages someone whose
life is an embodiment of a problem, or whose survival represents the gaining
of a goal, his death the losing of it.</p>

<p>These two approaches to the study of politics complement each other,
just as the physician and clergyman both mean to keep their identical
patient and parishioner well and whole. The novelist can, however, enter
well into the scientist’s field. When he deals with actual events, he tries to
record them as they happened. If the names and places are changed, he is
usually faithful to the manner or meaning of the events. In <em>Bricks Without
Straw</em> Albion W. Tourgée assures the reader that these events or others
exactly like them took place during the Reconstruction era in the South,
and there is no reason to doubt him. Sinclair’s <em>Oil!</em> exhaustively treats the
Sacco-Vanzetti case; it is completely opinionated, but it is a historical account,
nonetheless, of one of the most memorable political cases in American
history. More than a historian, the political novelist is also an analyst.
He sees cause-effect relationships at work, he looks into stimulus and response,
motivation and satisfaction. Stendhal is not content merely to
describe military and political events during the Napoleonic era; he goes
beneath the surface to explain what some of them meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<h3>The Purposes of This Study</h3>

<p>This examination of the political novel will go beyond simply charting
its development. In order to examine it as a distinct literary form, it will be
necessary to discuss its practitioners, the literary techniques they use, the
purposes they aim at, and their success in achieving them. More than this,
there will be attention to the function of these political novels, at the time
they were written and now in our time. In the forefront will be an attempt
to show what the reader can learn, whether he approaches this body of work
from a particular discipline such as political science or literature, or whether
he goes to it as a general reader wanting either enlightenment or entertainment.</p>

<p>The purposes and scope of each chapter indicate the purposes of the
study as a whole. Chapter Two, “The Novel as Political Instrument,” examines
the effect of the political novel on politics. Some novels contain
heroes presented against a political background which might just as well
have been mercantile or medical; other novels are intended to have politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
as their subject; still other novels are meant to have definite political consequences.
This chapter is chiefly concerned with novels of this last type. But
it is necessary to look at others, too, for in creating life in his novel the
artist will often reflect his own preferences, and they may affect those of his
reader. Chapter Three, “The Novelist as Political Historian,” describes the
way in which the writer may weave into his story the threads of history,
recording not only the lives of his creations, but actual events in the lives of
nations. By virtue of his special skills, he can recreate these events with a
vividness found in few scholarly histories. Chapter Four, “The Novel as
Mirror of National Character,” is devoted to an examination of the cultural
and national differences discernible in these novels. There appear to be
some denominators of political behavior which remain common no matter
what the scene of action. This chapter deals with the numerators, the
quantities which vary from culture to culture. Chapter Five, “The Novelist
as Analyst of Group Political Behavior,” demonstrates the insight the novel
can give into political actions which derive from group attitudes, pressures,
and responses rather than individual ones. The novelist may use several
indices to determine how a society is structured, which of its groups is most
homogeneous, which most apparent in the effect it has upon the body
politic. Chapter Six, “The Novelist as Analyst of Individual Political Behavior,”
shows how the basic unit in all political equations is treated. The
novelist portrays the person who moves in the main stream of politics and
the one who stands on its edges. In most cases the acts of these people are
examined&mdash;their motives, their effects. As in any other kind of fiction, characters
are created who are complete individuals, believable and unique. But
sometimes they are also typical of a number of people. Chapter Seven,
“Some Conclusions,” emphasizes the major points made in the study. It
also discusses what may be expected of the political novel in the future.
The annotated bibliography gives the author, title, and date for each
novel.</p>

<p>In terms of organization, this study proceeds from the most direct relationship
between the novel and politics to the least direct relationship.
Chapter Two shows how this art form can actually influence the political
process. Chapter Six, on the other hand, indicates the way in which the
novel treats the individual, who, with the exception of the outstanding
leader, has far less direct influence upon politics than groups or nations.
Chapter Three deals with the way in which the novel has recorded some
major events in the political scientist’s field from the early nineteenth century
to the present. Chapters Four through Six proceed from larger to
smaller political units.</p>

<p>In short, the aims of this study are to indicate the gradual development
of the political novel in England and the United States, to show what it
has produced in several other countries, and to demonstrate the insights it
can give in this area of human behavior to students of literature, politics,
and related disciplines, and to the general reader.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >chapter two<br />
The Novel as Political Instrument</h2>
</div>


<p>A political novel written from a point of view favoring a particular faction
is a political instrument in effect even if not in intent. A writer may
sternly tell himself at the outset that he will be completely impartial, only
to have the reviewers note all sorts of bias, real or imagined, of which he
may not have been conscious. This happened to Turgenev when he published
<em>Fathers and Sons</em>, and it continues to happen every year. The intensity
of the authors’ feelings varies from obsessive preoccupation to
passing interest. The novels in this chapter were included because they
contain definite opinions, sometimes appeals, on political subjects. Some
of them never exhort the reader or seem to lead him by the hand to the
author’s point of view. But each of them contains material capable of influencing
the reader’s opinions about some phase of political activity. If a
novelist gains a reader’s support for a cause, arouses his distaste for a
course of action, or simply produces a reevaluation of previously accepted
beliefs, his work has served as a political instrument just as surely as a pamphlet
mailed by a national committee or a handbill stuffed into the mailboxes
of a sleeping city.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p class="big1 p2"><b>Harriet Beecher Stowe and the Civil War</b></p>

<p><em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> is a prime example of the novel as political instrument
both in intent and effect. Harriet Beecher Stowe declared in her
preface that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The object of these sketches is to awaken sympathy and feeling for the African
race, as they exist among us; to show their wrongs and sorrows, under a system
so necessarily cruel and unjust as to defeat and do away with the good effects
of all that can be attempted for them....</p>
</div>

<p>The book did more than awaken sympathy; its millions of copies helped
rouse the growing anti-slavery sentiment in the North, creating in part the
political climate out of which the Civil War grew and mustering moral support
for its prosecution. But the novel’s effects were not confined to America.
In <em>Literary History of the United States</em> Dixon Wecter called it “the
most influential novel in all history,” and Harold Blodgett noted that it
was used in the campaign that secured England’s Reform Act of 1867.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Raymond Weaver, in his introduction to the Modern Library edition, notes
that half a million Englishwomen signed an address of thanks to the author,
and that Russians were said to have emancipated their serfs after reading
the book. The hero of Edgar Lee Masters’ <em>Children of the Market Place</em>
says the book “was not really true,” but he records the praise it won from
Macaulay, Longfellow, George Sand, and Heine, and adds, “The winds of
destiny previously let loose were blowing madly now.”</p>

<p>Translated into nineteen languages, the novel was also dramatized. Eliza’s
flight across the ice and Simon Legree’s cruelty have become hackneyed,
but the author did not rely exclusively on such melodrama and tugging at
the heartstrings. The plot is interlarded with case histories of slavery&mdash;mothers
whose children were taken from them, women sold for “breeders,”
men taken from their families and sent down into the deep South. The
reader may feel that Legree is a villain so fiendish as to be unbelievable; he
may find the angelic Little Eva’s death scene, in which she cuts off golden
curls and distributes them to the sobbing family and retainers, cloying or
emetic. There are other characters, though, worth observing. Senator Bird
of Ohio, who had formerly supported the Fugitive Slave Act, shelters Eliza
before sending her to a Kentuckian who had freed his slaves and now runs a
stop on the Underground Railway. Artistically the novel is very bad. Its
structure sprawls, its melodrama creaks, and its sentiment oozes over hundreds
of pages peopled more often by cardboard figures than believable
human beings. This is another case, however, in which the reading public
paid no attention to critical standards. Mrs. Stowe concluded her novel
with the warning that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>not surer is the eternal law by which the millstone sinks in the ocean, than that
stronger law, by which injustice and cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath
of Almighty God!</p>
</div>

<p>Her words were prophetic, and her book helped to bring about the dies irae
of which she spoke.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Albion Tourgée: The Blunders of Reconstruction</b></p>

<p>Just as the political novel helped to prepare the way for the Civil War,
so it commented upon the events which followed it. In <em>A Fool’s Errand</em>
(1879) and <em>Bricks Without Straw</em> (1880), two awkward but intensely felt
books, Albion Tourgée criticized the tremendous blunders of the federal
government in the Reconstruction era. Using the same techniques of case
history, pathos, and melodrama as did Mrs. Stowe, Tourgée applauds the
intent of the federal Reconstruction program but is outraged and cynical
at the way it was carried out. He praises the work of the Freedmen’s
Bureau but laments its dissolution and the government’s virtual abandonment
of the Negro. Like Mrs. Stowe, Tourgée states the problem as
dramatically and appealingly as he can; then he offers his solution: education.
Both of Tourgée’s novels close with appeals for federal aid to education
in the South. The Negro is obviously in greatest need, but the aid is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
meant to be spread over the entire educational system. Discarding all pretense
at fiction and writing directly to the reader, Tourgée concludes <em>A
Fool’s Errand</em> by telling him that “Poor-Whites, Freedmen, Ku-Klux and
Bulldozers are all alike the harvest of ignorance. The Nation can not afford
to grow such a crop.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Perennial Theme: Corruption</b></p>

<p>In the 1880s the American political novel began to shift from the Civil
War and Reconstruction to the theme of corruption. This subject was explored
extensively during the next five decades. Whether the scene was
the national capitol, as in Henry Adams’ <em>Democracy</em> (1880), or a ward in
New York City, as in James L. Ford’s <em>Hot Corn Ike</em> (1923), the theme was
the same&mdash;the betrayal of public trust for private ends. Although many of
these novels were written in the resurgent school of Realism, all of them,
in their depiction of pervasive corruption, were capable of being political
instruments through the nature of the material which they treated if not
through their author’s intent. Whether the writer declaims through his
hero against public robbery or simply tries to present dispassionately what
he sees, the revulsion of the reader at the travesty of American political
ideals is likely to be the same.</p>

<p>There was one notable exception to this trend. It was Jack London’s <em>The
Iron Heel</em> (1908). Projecting his story into the future, he wrote of an
America under the dictatorship of an Oligarchy serving the interests of the
large corporate and industrial groups. The reader learns that the Oligarchy
was eventually overthrown, but the book concentrates upon a fictitious era
of horrors unequalled until the appearance of Orwell’s <em>1984</em> forty years later.
In his introduction to the novel, Anatole France called London a Revolutionary
Socialist. This he was, and&mdash;in the novel, at least&mdash;a devoted Marxist
as well. The book was clearly meant to be a political instrument. Its fulfillment
of this aim may be judged by a comment of Stephen Spender in his
contribution to <em>The God That Failed</em> (1950). He remarks that Harry
Pollitt, a high official of the English Communist Party, had told him that
in his opinion <em>The Iron Heel</em> was “the best revolutionary novel.” The Communist
view of the propaganda value of literature makes the comment
significant.</p>

<p><b>Upton Sinclair: Corruption Plus Radicalism.</b> Upton Sinclair’s books were
among those which marked the beginning of a transitional phase in the
American political novel. In them a new theme was added to that of political
corruption: the rise of leftist and radical forces. <em>Oil!</em> (1926) focuses
on Bunny Ross’s political journey to the far Left. Bunny’s father, J. Arnold
Ross, is one of the tycoons who selects, pays for, and elects an American
president. Naming names and placing places, Sinclair sends his characters
into the campaign of 1920. Verne Roscoe says that he is negotiating with
Barney Brockway of “the Ohio gang.” Sinclair writes that “he made exactly
the right offers, and paid his certified checks to exactly the right men,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and Warren Harding was nominated. The fifty million dollars poured into
the campaign by the oil interests (according to Sinclair) helped to finish
the job. The account of the naval reserve oil lease scandals which follows
makes Sinclair’s position on the activities of a powerful lobby very clear.
More an exposé than a work of art, the novel describes attempts to hinder
the organization of the oil workers and the strikes and strike-breaking which
follow. The book ends with an attack upon</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>an evil power which roams the earth, crippling the bodies of men and women,
and luring the nations to destruction by visions of unearned wealth, and the
opportunity to enslave and exploit labor.</p>
</div>

<p>Two years later Sinclair threw himself into a vindication of the characters
and lives of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. The cast of
<em>Boston</em> (1928) includes the fictitious Thornewell family, but they are all
dwarfed by the two Italians whose careers ended in the electric chair. Sinclair
presents the case as an effort by the city and state governments to
dispose of two representatives of the anarchist movement which was
thought to threaten society’s foundations. He maintains that the government
was supported in its attempt by representatives of organized religion
as well as the socially prominent and economically powerful classes. Although
the author said that he had tried to be a historian, that he had not
“written a brief for the Sacco-Vanzetti defense,” the novel is precisely that.
It is also an indictment of most of the immediate society in which the
events took place. He accuses the prosecution of carefully building an
illegal, trumped-up case heard by the violently prejudiced Judge Thayer.
He declares that the Commission which investigated the case, made up of
Cardinal O’Connell, Bishop Lawrence, and President Lowell of Harvard,
rendered an endorsement of the state’s actions which amounted to a whitewash.
Running parallel to the story of the Italians is that of Jerry Walker,
parvenu tycoon of the New England felt industry who is legally plundered
by the old commercial and banking interests of Boston and New York. Mr.
Sinclair’s intentions to be impartial may have been sincere, but like the
exclamation points in his prose, they got away from him.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Growing Political Consciousness: 1930 to 1954</b></p>

<p>The great wave of political consciousness which struck America in the
1930s surged over into the novel. It took several forms. There was the novel
which advocated liberal reforms in government, and the novel which, presenting
the Communist point of view, necessarily went farther. The proletarian
novel emerged. Sympathetically describing the privations of the
so-called proletariat to stimulate betterment of its living conditions, these
novels sometimes cleaved to the Communist Party line but were often the
work of non-Communist authors writing from genuine concern for their
subjects. The Communists regarded this art form as another weapon in the
class struggle. Paul Drummond, a fanatical Communist writer in James T.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Farrell’s <em>Yet Other Waters</em> (1952), shouts that “now the time has come
for Party literature.” Moses Kallisch, leader of a front organization starting
a Left Wing Book Club, declares, “The day is not far off when we’ll overwhelm
bourgeois culture in America!” Increasing consciousness of the
political malignancy of Fascism and Nazism appeared in the novel. With
the descriptions of these dangers came appeals for the strengthening and
defense of the best in the American political system.</p>

<p><b>John Steinbeck: The Party Organizer.</b> Appearing in 1936, Steinbeck’s <em>In
Dubious Battle</em> sociologically described the violent course and tragic end of
a Communist-organized strike of apple pickers in California’s Torgas Valley.
Shortly after he applies for membership in the Party, young Jim Nolan is
taken down into the valley by McLeod, a hard-shelled, veteran Communist
organizer. The underpaid pickers, living in squalor, follow Mac when he
helps precipitate the strike. As the apprentice, Jim follows each move carefully,
learning both theory and practice from Mac, who wants violence and
a prolonged strike in order to gain wide attention and pave the way for
organizing subsequent picking operations. Adept and devoted, Jim learns
quickly despite a gunshot wound and increasing hunger. He even assumes
temporary leadership over Mac when the latter’s vitality momentarily sags.
At the book’s end, with the strike failing, Jim falls into a trap and his face
is blown off by a shotgun blast. Mac carries his body to the strikers’ camp
platform. The book’s last line is Mac’s funeral oration for Jim: “Comrades!
He didn’t want nothing for himself.” The novel may be considered a
social and political study; the picture that emerges is one of economic oppression,
embattled workers, and hard but devoted organizers.</p>

<p><b>Sinclair Lewis: Native Fascism.</b> Sinclair Lewis’s fifteenth book also appeared
in 1936, and its title is an indication of the jolt it was meant to give to
American complacency. <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em> is the story of the American
republic transformed into a Fascist corporate state through a military coup
d’état made possible by an electorate which was attracted by share-the-wealth
schemes, anti-minority agitation, and primitive emotionalism. The
methods of the Nazis and Fascists are applied to eradicate the democratic
system and even the boundaries of states. The country is divided into eight
provinces, concentration camps devour the dissenters and the suspect, and
all of American life is harshly regimented. Lewis’s hero is “bourgeois intellectual”
Doremus Jessup. After he has lost his newspaper, his daughter,
and his son-in-law, he becomes a member of the New Underground. When
revolution wins back only half the country, he enters the other half as a
secret agent. This novel has most of the faults and virtues of Lewis’s other
books: character merging into caricature, complete lack of subtlety, and
embarrassingly awkward dialogue; but with this there is accurate social
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
criticism, a genuine if crude vitality, and&mdash;particularly in this novel&mdash;a very
earnest concern for American traditions. Lewis’s point is made clear as
Jessup reflects that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the tyranny of the dictatorship isn’t primarily the fault of Big Business, nor
of the demagogues who do their dirty work. It’s the fault of Doremus Jessup!
Of all the conscientious, respectable, lazy-minded Doremus Jessups who have
let the demagogue wriggle in, without fierce enough protest.</p>
</div>

<p><b>John Dos Passos and Ernest Hemingway: Liberal Causes Abroad.</b> Glenn
Spotswood’s geographical and political odyssey, abruptly ended by a rebel
bullet in the Spanish Civil War, forms the central theme of Dos Passos’ <em>Adventures
of a Young Man</em> (1938). Politically conscious even as a boy, Glenn
becomes successively a transient worker, a cum laude college graduate, a
Communist labor organizer, and a disillusioned member of a splinter group.
Clearly and dispassionately, Dos Passos allows his story to unfold. There
are unsavory, dislikable characters such as fierce but noncombatant Comrade
Irving Silverstone and sinister Jed Farrington, an American Communist
who, as a Spanish loyalist colonel, divides his lethal attentions between
the rebels and political unreliables. But one has the feeling that the
author is not leaning in any direction. In the prose poems interspersed
throughout the novel, however, Dos Passos lectures his reader. The concluding
paragraph analyzes the growth of the American Communist Party
and explains the gullibility of the Americans deceived by it. The last lines
tell the reader that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>only a people suspicious of self-serving exhortations willing to risk decisions,
each man making his own, dare call themselves free, and that when we say the
people, ... we mean every suffering citizen, and more particularly you and me.</p>
</div>

<p>A little less obvious was the position of Ernest Hemingway in his fine
novel <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em> (1943). Hemingway would very probably
disclaim any intent to write a political novel, but his book teaches a lesson
in one of the oldest and surest ways&mdash;by example. Robert Jordan has left
his instructorship in Spanish at the University of Montana to go to Spain
as a demolition expert for the loyalists. Although he has placed himself
under Communist discipline for military reasons, he is not a Communist.
He is a teacher who has taken a most un-sabbatical leave to fight Fascism
in a country he loves. Following the pattern of most of these books,
Hemingway sums up a few pages from the end. Badly injured and unable
to make his escape, Jordan lies waiting in the forest to fight a fatal rearguard
action which will buy time for his escaping friends. He thinks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have fought for what I believed in for a year now. If we win here we will win
everywhere. The world is a fine place and worth the fighting and I hate very
much to leave it.</p>
</div>

<p>In <em>Number One</em> (1943), Dos Passos shifted from dictatorship abroad to
dictatorship at home. Chuck Crawford is reminiscent of the late Huey
Long of Louisiana. Magnetic, dynamic, and unscrupulous, Chuck wins the
governorship and then goes on to the United States Senate. His personal
aide is the alcoholic Tyler Spotswood, Glenn’s older brother. Served up as
the goat in an oil lease scandal which breaks about Chuck’s head, Tyler
allows himself to remain silent and be convicted. This is primarily because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of Glenn’s last letter from Spain exhorting Tyler not to let them “sell out”
the people at home. Tyler apparently feels that his conviction is an atonement
for failure to accept the responsibility which Sinclair Lewis also said
devolved upon each citizen. In the novel’s last three lines Dos Passos looks
the reader squarely in the eye: “weak as the weakest, strong as the strongest,
the people are the republic, the people are you.”</p>

<p><em>The Grand Design</em> appeared in 1949 to complete the <em>District of Columbia</em>
trilogy. In this third novel, Dos Passos’ style remains the same&mdash;detached
and impersonal, straightforward and clear. His politics (in the prose poems)
seem unchanged. He appears to be liberal, to retain his sympathy for the
smaller people having a difficult time economically. Since the book covers
the war years, the danger represented by the Axis powers is evident, but the
equally pernicious influence of militant international Communism is
equally clear. Although the book is jammed with characters from many
political strata, its primary focus is the career of Millard Carroll, who leaves
his Texarcola business to join the New Deal Farm Economy Administration.
As the war progresses, Carroll comes to feel that the Four Freedoms
are being forgotten in its prosecution. He sees personal jealousies and conflicts
within the administration. By implication, the program which produced
relocation camps for Japanese-Americans helps to complete his disillusionment.
Finally, crushed by personal tragedy, he resigns. The last line
of the last prose poem tells the reader, “Today we must learn to found again
in freedom our republic.”</p>

<p><b>George Weller: International Communism.</b> In 1949 George Weller’s <em>The
Crack in the Column</em> drew attention to one of the widespread areas in
which the Comintern was trying to extend Russian domination. The scene
is Greece. The novel reaches its climax when ELAS, the army of the
Communist-dominated EAM popular front group, fights the British in the
streets of Athens while the American army contains the Germans’ last great
effort in the Ardennes. Shot down earlier on a mission, American bomber
pilot Tommy McPhail decides not to be evacuated by the underground
net of British Major Walker. He remains to engage in similar behind-the-lines
work. Walker becomes McPhail’s tutor in global politics as well as
espionage. His primary subject is the need for the United States to accept
responsibility for creating international conditions favorable to the West,
as he says Britain has done. Walker tells McPhail that the United States
must learn to recognize Soviet strategy and combat it by such means as
permanent American bases in the Middle East. Once again, the most explicit
statement of the book’s message is saved for the end:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You Americans just pay your way out of the positions of the last war, then
[help] your way back into the same positions in the next. You forget that war
is continuous and this everlasting series of visits to the strategic pawnshop a
wasteful streak of postponement of the eventual showdown.</p>
</div>

<p>Like many other novels which can be regarded accurately as political instruments,
this one, with its accomplished delineation of a complex situation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
tangled relationships, and deep cross-currents, contains no direct
appeals to the reader. Neither does it have any scowling villains or radiant
heroes. But the portrayal of the growing political maturity of the naïve
American under the tutelage of the able but weary Englishman may perhaps
achieve the same effect, and do it better.</p>

<p><b>Norman Mailer: The Extreme Left.</b> The voice of the extreme Left, rarely
heard in recent American novels, sounded in Norman Mailer’s <em>Barbary
Shore</em>, a murky mixture of obscure symbolism, endless conversation, and
political theory disguised as dialogue. Published in 1951, the novel met with
a generally unfavorable critical reception. A reading bears out this verdict.
McLeod, apparently speaking for the author as his <em>raisonneur</em>, discusses
what he calls revolutionary socialism at great length. Rejecting Russian
Communism as state capitalism, McLoed’s two-thousand-word, non-stop
lecture envisions a mutually destructive war between “the Colossi.” The
Lenin of tomorrow, with the surviving theorists and proletariat, must be
ready to spring to the barricades of the rubble-strewn “hundred Lilliputs”
which survive. Before he is killed, McLoed passes his concept of Marxian
revolutionary socialism like a Grail or a sword to Mikey Lovett. He is to
keep it in readiness for the day when it can be used. This novel is intensely
political. Despite its ambiguousness and withheld secrets, its essential point
emerges: the first socialist revolution was betrayed; the true revolutionary
socialism must make the second one successful.</p>

<p><b>Novels of the Cold War.</b> As wartime cooperation with the Russians was
superseded by a growing awareness of the nature of militant Communism
and the Moscow-oriented loyalties of American Communists, the novel
chronicled this awakening. In <em>The Grand Design</em> Paul Graves had told
Millard Carroll that a Russian purchasing commission or a Russian-controlled
political party meant “espionage and counter-espionage and counter-counterespionage
ad infinitum....” Novels like Irwin Shaw’s <em>The Troubled
Air</em> (1951) and William Shirer’s <em>Stranger Come Home</em> (1954) recorded
the violence of this reaction. The function of these novels as political
instruments was to rouse indignation against the forces which, in seeking
to destroy American Communism, use methods as authoritarian and undemocratic
as those of the Soviets themselves. Both novels enlist the
reader’s sympathies on the side of loyal, non-Communist Americans who
are unjustly attacked by self-appointed judges using lies and questionable
methods. These courageous protagonists are virtually ruined professionally
and economically, for their integrity forbids them salvation through conformity
forced upon them by fanatical groups. <em>The Troubled Air</em> embodies
the problem in the efforts of director Clement Archer to keep his radio
actors employed until they can defend themselves against charges of
Communism made by <em>Blueprint</em>. This magazine, like some which have
appeared on the American scene, specializes in allegations of Communist
Party membership or sympathies on the part of entertainers. Archer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
actions, exceedingly dangerous to his own position through his lack of
awareness of the nature of his opponents, cost him his job. This novel is
less a <em>roman à clef</em>, more complex, and far more accomplished than Shirer’s
book. Archer is victimized not only by <em>Blueprint</em> and the people who surrender
to it, but by two of the people he defends. Frances Motherwell
renounces Communism and denounces Archer. Vic Herres, an old friend
and secretly a fanatical Communist, has acted for his cell in selecting
Archer as a “convenient point of attack,” one who would fight the Communists’
battle for them. The novel thus records the painful education of
an honorable man whose naïveté about American Communists is matched
by his ignorance of their opponents who borrow Communist methods.
The book is very well done, and in the reader-association with Archer
which it produces, it provides a vicarious ordeal of arbitrarily assumed guilt-by-association
with no recourse to conventional legal relief.</p>

<p><em>Stranger Come Home</em> is a fictionalized account of a group of similar
cases familiar to most newspaper readers. Here the spark is ignited by a
publication called <em>Red Airwaves</em>. Commentator Raymond Whitehead has
been blacklisted after his defense of Foreign Service officer Stephen Burnett,
accused of Communist sympathies before the investigating committee of
Senator O’Brien. Burnett is charged with conspiring to give China to the
Communists. He has actually done nothing more than follow the foreign
policy of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations and criticize the
corruption he saw in the regime of Chiang Kai-shek. Whitehead successively
loses his sponsor, his air time, and his job. While he is in Europe
he is accused by Senator O’Brien of being a Soviet agent. This charge is
based upon the testimony of two ex-Communists who have become professional
witnesses against people like Burnett and Whitehead. To give
immediacy and the personal impact of the experience, the book is written
in diary form. Although its fidelity to actual events makes it seem a
transcription and though its quality as a work of art is not outstanding, the
novel succeeds in driving its point home. The villains are quite black and
the heroes are quite white despite the peccadillo here and there meant apparently
to humanize them. Nevertheless, the reader who grants belief and
sympathy to Burnett and Whitehead will be hard put to suppress indignation
and fear at the people, methods, and events which combine to bring
near ruin to two intelligent and patriotic United States citizens.</p>

<p>In 1952 Paul Gallico’s <em>Trial by Terror</em> chronicled the ordeal of Jimmy
Race, reporter for the Paris edition of the <em>Chicago Sentinel</em>. Slipping into
Hungary to unearth the story behind the conviction and twenty-year
sentence meted out to an American named Frobisher, Race is arrested.
Brainwashed and tortured into a false confession at a propaganda trial,
Race is sentenced to prison. When his release is eventually secured, he is
a fear-ridden, completely disorganized personality, an animal conditioned
to confession as completely as Pavlov’s dog was to salivation. But his
destruction is not the only cause for anger. His liberation was not achieved
by his government, but by his editor, who was able to blackmail the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Hungarian Minister of Affairs because of Titoist activities. The feeling
throughout the book is that the United States embassy played a diplomatic
game in which the deadliest weapons were strongly worded notes. The
final irony is that the release was accomplished by a private citizen forced
to use Communist methods of blackmail and intimidation. This novel
graphically indicts Soviet brutality. It also criticizes American policy in a
dramatic aspect of the cold war.</p>


<p class="center p2 big1">GREAT BRITAIN</p>

<p>The English political novel appeared somewhat earlier than its American
counterpart. Its subjects range over a wider area and its varieties of political
experience are more numerous. As a political instrument, however, the
English novel is very like the American.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Benjamin Disraeli: Revitalized Toryism</b></p>

<p>In the preface to the fifth edition of <em>Coningsby</em>, coming five years after
first publication in 1844, Benjamin Disraeli, later Prime Minister and Earl of
Beaconsfield, made no pretense about his intent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The main purpose of its writer was to vindicate the just claims of the Tory party
to be the popular political confederation of the country.... It was not originally
the intention of the writer to adopt the form of fiction as the instrument to
scatter his suggestions, but, after reflection, he resolved to avail himself of a
method which, in the temper of the times, offered the best chance of influencing
opinion.</p>
</div>

<p>This novel was the first of three which comprised Disraeli’s <em>Young England</em>
trilogy. In a somewhat unsubstantial way, the three books set forth the
principles which were to create a revitalized Tory party. In <em>The Political
Novel</em> Morris Speare concludes that the four major points of the program
deal with the nobility, the middle class, the working class, and the English
church. The nobility was to reassume the leadership it held before patents
of nobility were doled out freely to clever entrepreneurs and favorite retainers
of great families. An aristocracy in function as well as name, it was
to be assisted by the vigorous industrial and mercantile middle class which
had arisen in England since the industrial revolution. The lot of the
working class was to be bettered by a sympathetic government rather than
by militant movements from within its own ranks. Moral and spiritual
leadership was to be supplied by a revitalized church true to its fundamental
religious tradition. Harry Coningsby, grandson of the dissolute
and immensely powerful Lord Monmouth, is the personification of Young
England. A hero at Eton and Cambridge, he returns from a year of travel
on the continent to enter politics. Refusing to sit in Parliament for one
of Monmouth’s rotten boroughs and act as a rubber stamp for old Tory
policies, Coningsby is cut out of Monmouth’s will. Monmouth’s death
and a neatly juggled legacy eventually pave the way for Coningsby’s entry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
into Parliament on his own terms. Patly, Coningsby of the nobility marries
Edith Millbank, daughter of a middle class tycoon.</p>

<p>A year later, <em>Sybil</em> followed <em>Coningsby</em>. Like substitutes in a football
game, Charles Egremont and Trafford go in for Coningsby and Millbank.
Much of the book is concerned with the working class. Disraeli shows the
reader the horrible conditions in which many of its members live and the
violence of their attempts to better them. Bishop Hatton, barbarous ruler
of the locksmiths of the mining district village of Wodgate, leads his
“Hell-cats” in an assault upon ancient Mowbray Castle. Unions are presented
as groups of violent men, cloaked and hooded. Supplementing this
portrayal is one of a decaying and greedy aristocracy. One can perhaps
imagine the reaction of the landed or moneyed English voter. He might
well accept Disraeli’s opinion that something had to be done.</p>

<p><em>Tancred</em> completed the trilogy in 1847. The hero is the sheltered great-grandson
of the Duke of Bellamont, who “might almost be placed at the
head of the English nobility.” The introspective Tancred is preoccupied
with religion and the direction it can give to human affairs particularly in
the areas of politics and government. Unable to find the answers to his
questions in England and unwilling to enter Commons until he has them,
he makes a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. At this point the novel dissolves
into a panorama of kidnapings, desert intrigues, and mountain kingdoms
reminiscent of Rudolph Valentino movies. Tancred becomes absorbed with
“the great Asian mystery” which is to assist in the moral regeneration of the
West, particularly England. Overwhelmed by Emirs and Sheikhs, Turks
and Druses, the novel is the weakest of the three. But together the books
are a prime example of an art form carefully selected and used to gain
a hearing for a political program.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Henry James: The Breakup of Victorian Tranquillity</b></p>

<p><em>The Princess Casamassima</em>, published by Henry James in 1886, is one
of the novels which focused upon the revolutionary currents beginning to
stir beneath the surface of English political life. Irving Howe has called
it a warning that something had to be done to alleviate the misery of the
poor. These conditions had given rise to radical groups such as that which
met at the Sun and Moon Tavern under the leadership of Paul Muniment.
The personal tragedy of his friend Hyacinth Robinson forms the novel’s
central theme. The sensitive, disinherited inhabitant of two worlds, Robinson
is the illegitimate son of a Frenchwoman who had murdered her titled
lover. Robinson’s maternal grandfather had fallen on the barricades of the
French Revolution. Raised with the help of Eustache Poupin, exiled
veteran of the French Commune, Robinson feels that he is heir to a revolutionary
background. Emotionally exalted, he declares his willingness for
self-sacrifice at a group meeting. From that time on, like the protagonist
of <em>The Beast in the Jungle</em>, Robinson waits for the summons to fulfill his
destiny. But meanwhile he falls under the spell of the Princess, who takes
a dilettante interest in the lives of the poor and the activities of the radical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
movement. Partly under her influence and partly as a result of a trip to
Venice and Paris made possible by a small legacy, Robinson finds his
revolutionary ardor waning. In his admiration for the richness of European
civilization, he becomes reluctant to act as an agent of its eventual destruction.
When the summons comes for him to assassinate a duke, he shoots
himself instead. James presents a gallery of types: the guilty aristocrat, a
member of the decayed gentility, the professional revolutionary, and the
industrious poor. In this novel James is concerned as always with personal
relationships, backgrounds, and motivations. He also presents an environment
out of which political violence can explode. And his feelings about
the need for preventing it are clear.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Joseph Conrad: Early Cloak and Dagger</b></p>

<p>In 1907 Joseph Conrad explored this problem from the same point of
view in <em>The Secret Agent</em>. In the author’s note which introduced the novel,
Conrad wrote that a friend had mentioned anarchist activities. This was
the germ of the story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I remember, however, remarking on the criminal futility of the whole thing,
doctrine, action, mentality; and on the contemptible aspect of the half-crazy
pose as of a brazen cheat exploiting the poignant miseries and passionate
credulities of a mankind always so tragically eager for self-destruction. That was
what made for me its philosophical pretences so unpardonable.</p>
</div>

<p>Conrad then had his point of view; his recollection of an attempt to blow
up the Greenwich Observatory gave him the outlines of his plot. A “delegate
of the Central Red Committee,” Adolf Verloc is actually an informer
and agent provocateur for many years in the pay of the embassy of a “great
power” (probably Russia). His principal function is to transmit warnings
of planned bomb-throwings to insure the safety of “royal, imperial, or
grand-ducal journeys....” Called to the embassy, Verloc is told by first
secretary Vladimir that the conference in Milan is lagging in its “deliberations
upon international action for the suppression of political crime....”
England is chiefly responsible, Vladimir tells him. He orders Verloc to
provide a stimulus in the form of an attack “with all the shocking senselessness
of gratuitous blasphemy.” Verloc is ordered to blow up the Observatory.
Always a businessman and never a terrorist, he is deeply disturbed.
Obtaining a bomb, Verloc sends his admiring half-wit brother-in-law
Stevie out with it. But Stevie stumbles and blows up himself rather
than the Observatory. When Verloc’s wife learns what has happened, she
kills him and then commits suicide. To add to the impact of the story,
Conrad wove into it the characters of Karl Yundt, an evil old terrorist, and
the Professor, a “perfect anarchist” who spends his life in experiments to
develop the perfect detonator. In <em>The Great Tradition</em> F. R. Leavis has
rightly called this book “one of Conrad’s two supreme masterpieces.” In
its structure, its delineation of personality, and its masterful manipulation
of point of view, the book is a classic. It is an example of the superiority
of the European political novel, one of the finest works in the entire genre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><em>Under Western Eyes</em> was written from the same point of view as <em>The
Secret Agent</em>. Appearing in 1910, the novel dealt with the same sort of
groups Conrad had treated three years earlier. But now the area was wider,
the figures larger, and the stakes bigger. Kirylo Razumov, another illegitimate
like Hyacinth Robinson, is studying at St. Petersburg University for
a career in the civil service. His life is disrupted when Victorovitch Haldin
seeks refuge in his rooms after blowing up the President of a Repressive
Commission which had imprisoned, exiled, or hanged many Russians considered
disloyal to the Czar. Afraid of being suspected of complicity and
enraged at what he feels is gratuitous destruction of the only life he can
make for himself, Razumov, on the advice of his father, Prince K&mdash;&mdash;,
betrays Haldin to the police. His life now completely disoriented, Razumov
is persuaded by the Prince and Councilor Mikulin to go to Geneva. Regarded
as a hero and the accomplice of Haldin, he enters the revolutionary
circle led by the famous Peter Ivanovitch. His job is to report their plans
to Mikulin. But then, despite himself, he falls in love with Haldin’s sister
Nathalia. He confesses his betrayal of Haldin to her and then to the circle.
Maimed by the circle’s executioner, Razumov stumbles out onto the street
and into the path of a tram car. At the novel’s end he has returned to
Russia with but a short time to live. Again, Conrad’s point of view affects
the reader through the tragedies he describes, the object-lesson characters
he creates, and the comments they make. The narrator and Conrad’s
raisonneur, an anonymous teacher of English in Geneva, is the source of
many of these comments. When he sees Nathalia about to return to Russia
as a dedicated worker, he thinks of her believing in “the advent of loving
accord springing like a heavenly flower from the soil of men’s earth, soaked
in blood, torn by struggles, watered with tears.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>E. M. Forster: The Problem of Imperialism</b></p>

<p>Out of E. M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em> (1924) comes a compassionate
plea for British understanding of India. But even understanding is not
enough; there must also be love. This great subcontinent, divided by
geography, economics, caste, and religion, has a heritage of misery and
discord. The book’s two great themes are the divisions which sunder India
and the love which alone can make it whole. It has been taken by the
British without love in a union which is rape. In one of the parallels which
inform the theme, this action is represented on the interpersonal level by
the projected loveless marriage of Adela Quested and British civil servant
Ronny Heaslop. The novel moves to a climax when the hysterical Adela
mistakenly accuses the sensitive Dr. Aziz, a Mohammedan Indian, of attempted
rape in the sinister Marabar caves. Aziz is acquitted, but his career
is ruined and his spirit desolated. But the influence of Ronny’s dead
mother, Mrs. Moore, returns, through the memory of her and the presence
of her two other children, to dispel some of the evil. At the book’s end
Aziz achieves a partial reconciliation with Cyril Fielding, the Englishman
who has defended him at the cost of ostracism. But as they part Aziz shouts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If it’s fifty-five hundred years we shall get rid of you, yes, we shall drive every
blasted Englishman into the sea, and then ... you and I shall be friends.</p>
</div>

<p>As an appeal either for love or withdrawal from India, the book is a political
instrument. It is also a revealing commentary upon one of the causes of
what Winston Churchill called “the dismemberment of the British Empire.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Aldous Huxley and George Orwell: The Future in Perspective</b></p>

<p>Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em> (1932) and Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, which followed
it seventeen years later, are political instruments through the honor and
revulsion they will create in any reader whose political beliefs are formed
by the democratic tradition. Although both these fine novels are written
in the future, neither is a fairy tale spun from air. Their only resemblance
to fairy tales is a horde of enough all-too-real goblins and witches to make
a month of <em>Walpurgisnachts</em>. Huxley, using godlessness and immorality,
and Orwell, using totalitarian government, create nightmares well calculated
to increase resistance to tendencies in modern life which could
produce the results so strikingly conjured up in their novels.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">THE CONTINENT</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Ivan Turgenev and Fyodor Dostoyevsky: Nihilism and Its Rejection</b></p>

<p>In his helpful introduction to the Modern Library edition of <em>Fathers and
Sons</em>, Herbert Muller writes that Ivan Turgenev’s <em>A Sportsman’s Sketches</em>,
which appeared in 1852, had created an effect similar to <em>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</em> in America. <em>Fathers and Sons</em> (1862), treating revolutionaries like
most of Turgenev’s books, had an even more lasting effect. Although both
the uproar and the Nihilist movement died down, Muller declares that the
novel “helped to form the mentality of the later revolutionaries who
established the Soviet Union.” The story deals with the return from college
of Arkady Kirsanov and his friend Yevgeny Bazarov. Nihilist Bazarov
dominates his disciple Arkady. Conflict quickly erupts. Arkady’s father
Nikolai is hurt by the distance between them, and his uncle Pavel seizes
upon a pretext for a duel in which Bazarov wounds him. Bazarov’s father
Vassily, pathetically eager to be close to his son, finds the gulf between
them even greater than that separating Arkady and Nikolai. The two
generations&mdash;one giving allegiance to religion and the old regime, the other
to science and revolutionary Nihilism&mdash;have lost almost all rapport with
each other. Turgenev treats the perennial aspect of this theme, yet he
particularizes it to mid-nineteenth century Russia. Eventually the gap between
the Kirsanovs is narrowed as Arkady marries and returns to administer
the estate with his father. But before Bazarov leaves he lashes
out at Arkady:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You’re not made for our bitter, rough, lonely existence.... Our dust would
get into your eyes ... you’re admiring yourselves unconsciously, you like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
abuse yourselves; but we’re sick of that&mdash;we want something else! we want to
smash people!</p>
</div>

<p>It may be, as Muller says, that Turgenev’s mind was with the sons and his
heart with the fathers, that he tried to be fair. Here is a case in which,
regardless of intent, a novelist helped to shape a movement which disrupted
a world.</p>

<p>Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky reacted violently to Turgenev’s work. The
former challenged him to a duel and the latter attacked and caricatured
him mercilessly as Karamazinov in <em>The Possessed</em> (1872), a violent attack
upon Nihilism. In his introduction to the Modern Library edition, Avrahm
Yarmolinsky declares that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dostoyevsky’s avowed intention in writing it was to drive home certain convictions
of his, regardless of whether or not he met the requirements of the art
of fiction. He wanted to deal a body blow to the rebels who threatened what
he considered to be the foundations of Russian life. Originally he conceived his
novel as a political lampoon, a pamphlet against the revolution.</p>
</div>

<p>In the massive book which he produced, Dostoyevsky fulfilled his purpose
by showing the effect upon a provincial capital of a group of revolutionaries
guided by a demoniac leader. Conspiracy, mob violence, arson, and murder
temporarily disrupt government. Pyotr Verhovensky returns from revolutionary
activity abroad to set up groups throughout Russia. He seeks to knit
together this particular group by making all of them participate in the
murder of a dissident member. Before he has fled and his group has been
caught, three more people have been killed. Nikolay Stavrogin, the book’s
perverted central figure, is meant to be the messiah of Pyotr’s movement.
The ruin of the whole structure is complete when, on the last page, Nikolay
dangles from his own silken noose. Recurring in the book and linked to
its title is the image of the biblical Gadarene swine. Pyotr’s father, estranged
from his abusive son, is dying partly because of a chain of events set in
motion by him. He asks that this passage be read to him and then exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those devils that come out of the sick man and enter into the swine. They are
all the sores, all the foul contagions, all the impurities, all the devils great and
small that have multiplied in that great invalid, our beloved Russia, in the
course of ages and ages.</p>
</div>

<p>The swine had plunged into the sea and destroyed themselves. Dostoyevsky
wanted to insure that his countrymen would not, like lemmings, follow
each other to destruction.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>André Malraux: Pro-Communism</b></p>

<p>An index of changing times is the contrast between <em>The Possessed</em> and
André Malraux’s <em>Man’s Fate</em>. This novel represented the opposite pole of
political thought. Published in 1934, Malraux’s book sympathetically followed
the abortive Communist attempt to capture Shanghai in 1927. Under
the leadership of half-French Kyo Gisors and others like him, the Chinese
Communists wage a losing battle against the Kuomintang party of Chiang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Kai-shek. This time the gallery of revolutionary types&mdash;theorists, assassins,
hard-core Party workers&mdash;is presented in a different light. They are heroes.
The professional revolutionists and disinherited peasants are following a
vision. Even when they receive the coup de grâce or await death in the
boiler of a locomotive, eventual victory is seen transcending temporary defeat.
Having given his cyanide to wounded comrades, the Russian Katov
is still able to reflect as he awaits his horrible end that “he had fought for
what in his time was charged with the deepest meaning and the greatest
hope; he was dying among those with whom he had wanted to live; he
was dying, like each of these men, because he had given a meaning to his
life.” These words are something like Robert Jordan’s valedictory to life.
But Jordan fought to preserve Spanish democracy and Katov died to establish
Chinese Communism. The novel serves all causes.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Ignazio Silone: Disillusionment on the Left</b></p>

<p>The first of a remarkable group of modern political novels appeared in
the same year as <em>Man’s Fate</em>. It was Ignazio Silone’s <em>Fontamara</em>. “The
poorest and most backward village of Marsica,” Fontamara is the scene
of progressive encroachments of Fascism upon the life of its people. Exploited
by The Promoter&mdash;a builder, banker, and local tycoon&mdash;the uneducated
peasants successively lose most of their water supply, the profits
from their hard-raised crops, and their right to talk about politics. When
the protests of some of its people make it appear that Fontamara is resisting
the Mussolini regime, Black Shirt thugs raid the village, abusing its people
and wrecking houses. Goaded by the need for work, Berardo Viola and the
son of the nameless narrator go to Rome to seek it. Fleeced of their money,
they finally obtain the necessary certificates of moral character. But The
Promoter has written upon them that the men are politically unreliable.
Thrown into jail upon suspicion of distributing copies of <em>The Unknown
Hand</em>, they meet the editor of this resistance leaflet. To save him, Berardo
assumes responsibility for the paper and is beaten to death by the police.
The editor succeeds in delivering a small press to Fontamara, where the
villagers begin their secret paper, which they call <em>What Shall We Do?</em> This
phrase is not only the title; it is printed at the end of each story of Fascist
atrocity. At the book’s end, the nameless narrator and his family are in
hiding with Silone. The village has been wiped out by the Fascists. The
book’s last line&mdash;not in quotes and therefore Silone’s question as well as
the narrator’s&mdash;is, of course, What Shall We Do?</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1937, the next of Silone’s fine political novels was
published. <em>Bread and Wine</em> marks the beginning of the disillusionment of
Silone’s heroes with Communism which culminates in <em>A Handful of
Blackberries</em> (1953). Pietro Spina, the central figure of <em>Bread and Wine</em>,
returns to Italy although hunted there as a Communist agitator. Ill and
perplexed, he goes into hiding in the poor mountain village of Pietrasecca
disguised as a priest, Don Paolo Spada. His disguise evolves into another
self, reviving and intensifying the inner conflict he has always felt through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a dual attraction to Christianity and Marxism. Before he returns to political
action he achieves a sort of synthesis of what he thinks are the best elements
of both beliefs, necessarily rejecting Russian Communism. Don Paolo tries
to give his old teacher Don Benedetto the essence of his belief:</p>

<p class="blockquot">If a poor man, alone in his village, gets up at night and takes a piece of chalk
or charcoal and writes on the village walls: “Down with the war! Long live the
brotherhood of all peoples! Long live liberty!” behind that poor man there
is the Lord.</p>


<p>In <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em> Rocco de Donatis returns to the village
of San Luca at the end of World War II. Formerly a fanatical Communist,
he breaks with the Party. The novel describes the Party’s attempt to ruin
his life and his fiancée’s. Figuring in the story is an ancient trumpet traditionally
used to call the peasants to action “when we just can’t stand things
any longer.” Rocco’s survival and the inability of the Communists to
seize the symbolic trumpet to pervert it to their own uses signalize a sort
of victory. In their total effect these novels are an indictment of both
Fascism and Communism. Simply written yet powerful, they display a deep
sympathy for the poor and oppressed.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Arthur Koestler: The Bolshevik on Trial</b></p>

<p>Like Orwell and Huxley, Arthur Koestler wrote a novel which, without
one plea or exhortation, is a political instrument through the strong emotional
and intellectual response which it can create. <em>Darkness at Noon</em>
(1941) tells the story of Nicolas Rubashov, an old Bolshevik once second
only to “No. 1” in what is unquestionably Russia. But now this legendary
hero of the Revolution lies in a small isolation cell awaiting the ordeal
which is to lead to confession and abnegation at a public treason trial.
Through the use of flashbacks, this stark and powerful novel traces Rubashov’s
career. All the usual elements are there&mdash;the devotion to the Party,
the cold betrayals, the blind obedience. Eventually the repressed questions
had risen to the surface. In attempting to work them out Rubashov had
arrived at disillusionment and “political divergencies.” Eventually he concludes
that the mistake was that “we are sailing without ethical ballast.”
The trial over, he is led down a dark corridor deep within the prison. He
reflects that Moses was allowed to see the Promised Land. “He, Nicolas
Salmanovitch Rubashov, had not been taken to the top of a mountain,
and wherever his eye looked, he saw nothing but desert and the darkness
of night.” An instant later the bullet crashes into the back of his head.
One is appalled not only at his career and those of the thousands of
Rubashovs who have helped to create the Soviet state, but at the whole
process which creates a Rubashov&mdash;and a No. 1.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">AFRICA</p>

<p>The inclusion of novels on contemporary South Africa in this study
comes near to disregarding the limits set up by our definition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
political novel, for certainly there is as much of the sociological and
economic in these novels as there is in <em>The Jungle</em> or <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>.
They are included, however, because politics plays as vital a part in the
South African problems portrayed in these novels as do the other two
factors. While the Blacks in the Union of South Africa are not slaves, their
treatment is an inflammatory subject, and the repressive measures taken
against them are political by their very nature. The Nationalist Party of
Prime Minister Malan owes its tenure in no small measure to its policy of
<em>apartheid</em>, strict segregation of Blacks from Whites.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Alan Paton: The Race Question</b></p>

<p>One of the most eloquent opponents of <em>apartheid</em> is Alan Paton, a
member of the Liberal Party and author of two fine novels dealing with
the general problem of race relations in South Africa: <em>Cry, The Beloved
Country</em> (1948) and <em>Too Late the Phalarope</em> (1953). Although both books
focus primarily upon interpersonal relationships, the tragedies which they
involve have their bases in the relations of the two races from which the
interacting characters are drawn. <em>Cry, The Beloved Country</em> tells a moving
and deeply pathetic story of the loss of two sons. The son of the Zulu
Stephen Kumalo, an Episcopal clergyman, murders the son of James Jarvis,
benefactor of old Kumalo’s church. Ironically, in Arthur Jarvis Absalom
Kumalo had killed a man who wanted to better the lot of Kumalo’s people.
In 1953 the equally moving <em>Too Late the Phalarope</em> set forth the tragic
story of Pieter Van Vlaanderen, police lieutenant of Venterspan and hero
to Black and White alike. Convicted of sexual relations with the unfortunate
Negress Stephanie, he is sentenced to prison and disgrace under
Act 5 of 1927, the Immorality Act. The immediate causes of Pieter’s
tragedy are his wife’s inability to give him complete understanding and
fulfillment, and the vindictive enemy he has created in Sergeant Steyn.
But the underlying causes are those which infect the Union of South Africa
with the virulent disease of racial hate and bigotry. Paton’s books are not
only compelling human documents, they are also pleas for the eradication
of the disease.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the novel’s preeminence as the literary form
superbly fitted to describe and interpret life is the space it gives the writer
to erect his structure, to illumine the nature of an individual, to characterize
a people, to describe both human units in relation to the world. With his
thousands of words the novelist can impart the shape he wants to the
elements which will make his own vision of life meaningful to his reader.
There is no better example of this characteristic of the novel than these
works which use its freedom to treat that increasingly complex phenomenon
of human activity&mdash;politics in its broadest sense. And, assuming the artist’s
privilege, he often makes his work a personal thing, producing not only a
work of art but a political instrument as well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >chapter three<br />
The Novelist as Political Historian</h2>
</div>



<p>If Art imitates Nature, the political novel imitates History. In almost
all these novels the starting point is a series of actual happenings. Filtered
through the artist’s consciousness, they sometimes emerge in curious forms.
But unless they are spun wholly from moonshine, like Crawford’s <em>An
American Politician</em>, they usually bear some clearly discernible relation to
the events of real life. Here again, the variety is great. Koestler’s <em>The Age
of Longing</em> (1951) is set in Europe of the future. In his words, “it merely
carries the present one step further in time&mdash;to the middle nineteen-fifties.”
An apprehensive continent, listening with one ear for the mushrooming of
atomic bombs, anxiously watches the United States and Russia, feeling
that its fate may be decided at any moment by a single move of either of
the giants. Although the time is the future, the running account of these
opponents’ moves which accompanies the story is based upon Koestler’s
interpretation of recent patterns in international affairs. Perhaps he is too
gloomy, but this is the pattern he sees: Russia trumpets alarms at what it
claims is aggression of a “Rabbit State”; an international crisis occurs and
the people clutch their Geiger counters and anti-radioactivity umbrellas;
the crisis is averted and tension relaxes; the Rabbit State is absorbed by
Russia as the United States sends a printed protest form. At the other end
of the scale is the roman à clef, represented by novels such as Gallico’s
<em>Trial by Terror</em> and Shirer’s <em>Stranger Come Home</em>, in which the characters
seem to be fictional counterparts of real people. The conventional disclaimer,
“any resemblance to actual people ...,” is usually present, but
the likeness is often too close to be explained by chance. A close parallel
to the events in Gallico’s book is provided by the experiences of Robert
Voegler and William Oatis. The ordeals of these two Americans were not
related, but to fictionalize and interconnect them is a logical procedure
for the writer building his novel around the subject of Americans falsely
arrested for espionage by Russian satellites.</p>

<p>The political novelist may cover a short period of time or he may widen
his canvas to accommodate a whole era. Stendhal’s <em>The Charterhouse of
Parma</em>, covers three decades, beginning in 1796 with Napoleon’s entry into
Milan and ending years later in the post-Napoleonic period. Howard
Spring’s <em>Fame Is the Spur</em> extends from the hero’s birth in 1865 to the day
when, heavy with honors, he participates as a peer in the coronation of
King George VI. And Hamer Shawcross is a politician, so the novel deals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
with three quarters of a century of Britain’s political life. As selective as
he wants to be, the novelist may comment upon any phase of political life.
The subjects in these novels range from small-town corruption to international
policy, from the rise and fall of men to the birth and death of
parties.</p>

<p>Since the reader knows there is a good chance that he will get a deliberately
subjective view of political history, there must be good reasons
for spending time on novels rather than going directly to Commager,
Beard, Macaulay, or Gibbon. Although a novelist may not make it as
obvious as did Thackeray, he is a god whose characters are his creations.
He looks into their minds and souls. He reveals their ambitions and exposes
their doubts more completely than any historian can do, even equipped
with the volumes of memoirs and apologias which appear periodically in
literary rashes. Even if the writer does not deal with real people, as do
Upton Sinclair and others, he may present a recognizable copy or a man
so typical as to shed light upon a specific class of political beings. The
historian may describe the Chartist riots or Borgia’s capture of Senigallia,
but he cannot do it with the vividness one finds in the accounts of Disraeli
and Maugham. Only rarely does a book like <em>The French Revolution</em> appear,
and writers like Carlyle are even more rare. Then too, if the novelist is
perceptive and detached, his description and analysis may be as acute as that
of the historian. Disraeli’s known point of view may make the interpretation
of history in <em>Sybil</em> suspect, but the aloofness and irony of Maugham’s <em>Then
and Now</em> not only add to a tale that is sometimes droll, they help to give
keen portraits of two very considerable men&mdash;Cesare Borgia and Niccolo
Machiavelli. The novelist has at his disposal all the resources of the historian,
as witness Sinclair’s use of the 3,900 pages of the Dedham trial
testimony in the Sacco-Vanzetti case. But he can do more than research.
He can follow his characters into Congress, into their offices, and into their
beds. He can also enter into the secret places of the brain, where lie the
ultimate springs of political action.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">GREAT BRITAIN</p>

<p>The English political novels included in this study present a panorama
of British history extending back to the early part of the nineteenth century.
A reading of them creates a picture of gradual change, of a surprisingly
orderly political evolution. Disraeli’s novels portray an England of immense
social and economic differences. Although patents of nobility are being
granted with increasing frequency, the society is much more static than
dynamic, with extremely little individual or group mobility. It is an England
of rotten boroughs, of voteless millions. The country’s political life goes
on in accordance with carefully defined rules, and the players remain the
same&mdash;the Whigs and Tories. The England of a hundred years later, seen
in <em>Fame Is the Spur</em>, is a different land. The Monarchy and the Church,
though changed, are still strong reference points in English life, but almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
everything else has altered. The franchise is no longer the exclusive possession
of the landed; suffrage has been extended to women. The old laissez
faire economy has evolved into one with considerable state regulation. The
Whigs have given way to the Liberals who, in turn, are about to be superseded
by the Labour Party. Actually, a revolution has taken place, but it
has occurred within the existing political framework.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>George Eliot: The Early Nineteenth Century in the Midlands</b></p>

<p>George Eliot’s <em>Felix Holt, the Radical</em> was published in 1866, but it
dealt with English politics in 1832. The plot, with its double identities,
confused litigation, and secret paternities, is labyrinthine. But the description
of English elections is sharp and vivid. Both the Whig and Radical
candidates hire mobs of miners and navvies to demonstrate for them. The
result is a bloody riot quelled by troops. Harold Transóme is a corrupt
Radical; his foil is Holt, the honest Radical charged with a murder committed
during the riot. The novel’s ending may seem sentimental and
contrived, but this does not lessen the value of the book as a study from
which emerges the political complexion of Laomshire in the English midlands.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Benjamin Disraeli and Anthony Trollope: Whigs v. Tories</b></p>

<p>In his effort to point up the need for a Young England party, Disraeli
exposes the abuses of early nineteenth century England. In <em>Coningsby</em> one
sees the millionaire Monmouth manipulate the twelve votes he owns in
Commons to attain a dukedom. In <em>Sybil</em> Charles Egremont attempts to
fit himself for public life by first investigating the conditions of the working
class. Thus Disraeli shows to his reader the farm and factory workers
and the miners who signed the National Petition of the Chartists. He
follows the House of Commons’ rejection of the Petition and the great
uprisings which follow. This author-politician does not simply offer his
own partisan solution to his country’s ills; he also shows the specific events
and general climate which elicit it.</p>

<p>Disraeli and Trollope have been praised at each other’s expense. Disraeli
had immensely greater political experience, but Trollope was by far the
better novelist. Trollope’s books are much more readable, and the student
of the political novel will find just as much information in them. Of his
six parliamentary novels, three make particularly profitable reading. <em>Phineas
Finn, The Irish Member</em> (1869) chronicles the rise and fall of a young
Liberal. Standing in 186- for the Borough of Loughshane in County Clare,
Finn comes in with the Liberal government which succeeds that of the
Tory Lord de Terrier. A member of the new cabinet is Mr. Gresham,
obviously modeled after Gladstone. The leader of the Conservative opposition
is Mr. Daubeny, who bears a striking resemblance to Disraeli. The
Reform Bill for England carries and Finn becomes Under Secretary for the
Colonies. When his conscience forbids him to conform to party policy by
voting against the Reform Bill for Ireland, he resigns his office and returns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
to Ireland, feeling that he has ruined his career in any case. In <em>Phineas
Redux</em> (1874) he returns to Parliament. Now Daubeny’s Tories are in,
hanging tenaciously to a dwindling advantage in order to retain patronage
and power as long as possible. Daubeny’s purposes are clear. Because of his
parliamentary tactics, he earns from Trollope the sobriquets “the great
Pyrotechnist” and “a political Cagliostro.” The culmination of the novel’s
love story, with which Trollope parallels the politics, is a spectacular trial
in which Finn is acquitted of murder. He is offered his old job at the
Foreign Office, but once more he retires from the field. Finn reappears in
<em>The Prime Minister</em> (1876). When Daubeny’s government goes out,
neither he nor Gresham can muster enough strength to form a new one.
The result is that now familiar phenomenon, a coalition government. The
new Prime Minister is the Duke of Omnium, and his Secretary for Ireland
is Phineas Finn. The country prospers under the coalition. But eventually
signs of strain appear, and with them the resignations of two ministers.
Finally, in its fourth year, the coalition founders on the County Suffrage Bill.
Winning his vote of confidence by the slim margin of nine, Omnium resigns.
It is left for the next government to complete the near-assimilation
of the county suffrages with those of the boroughs. The two thousand-odd
pages of these novels contain close likenesses of real politicians. They also
describe some of the basic issues and attitudes of this era, and detail the
workings of three distinctly different types of ministries.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>George Meredith: The Early Radical</b></p>

<p>In their <em>Outline-History of English Literature</em> Otis and Needleman describe
Meredith’s <em>Beauchamp’s Career</em> as “a political novel suggested by
the candidacy of Capt. Frederick Maxse of Southampton.” Published in
1876 and spanning the years 1850-1862, the novel highlights Commander
Nevil Beauchamp’s return from distinguished service in the Crimean War
to run for Parliament as a fire-eating Radical. With more descriptions of
canvassing and elections, the novel also contains the frequently found
criticism of the press, which is almost always regarded as an organ in which
truth runs a very bad second to political expediency. Before the novel
ends with Beauchamp’s tragic drowning, Meredith has given the reader his
record of another aspect of English political life on the local level in the
mid-nineteenth century.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Mrs. Humphrey Ward: Victorian Portraits</b></p>

<p>One of the chief values of Mrs. Humphrey Ward’s <em>Marcella</em> (1894) in
the study of English political currents is its catalog of types. The novel
follows the erratic romance of Marcella Boyce and Aldous Raeburn. Grandson
of Lord Maxwell, an old Tory politician, Raeburn enjoys a successful
career in Commons, eventually becoming an Under Secretary in the Home
Office. But the obstacle to true love is politics. Aldous is a Tory, and
Marcella is a Venturist, defined as “a Socialist minus cant.” The love
triangle is completely political, for Aldous’ rival Harry Wharton sits as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Liberal. He is, however, gradually drawing closer to the rising labor movement.
At one point Wharton gives the complete Socialist program for the
country districts. After a transitional period, he says, land and capital will
be controlled by the state. The emancipation of the laborer will mean that
“the disappearance of squire, State parson, and plutocrat leaves him master
in his own house, the slave of no man, the equal of all.” Wharton presides
at the Birmingham Labour Conference, speaking for graduated income tax
and nationalization of the land. At this conference Mrs. Ward introduces
the reader to the leaders of this new movement, from the moderates to the
violent radicals. In a concession to the happy ending, the author has
Wharton discredited for a rascal, thereafter reuniting Marcella and Aldous.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>H. G. Wells: England in Transition</b></p>

<p>In <em>The New Machiavelli</em> (1910) H. G. Wells dealt with Dick Remington,
whose career is ruined like that of Parnell by an extra-marital affair.
Before his fall, Dick changes from a Liberal to a Conservative. Reminiscent
of Disraeli’s novels (which he has read), he becomes a Young Imperialist
of the New Tory movement. Dick’s shifting of political allegiance is not
at all uncommon. This change of loyalties appears much more often in the
English novel than the American, and there is no opprobrium attaching
to it. Dick’s career, in which he takes his stand on such timely subjects as
woman suffrage, is the story of a journey from one political faith to another.
Its background is the political milieu of late Victorian and Edwardian
England.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Howard Spring: Labour and the Course of Empire</b></p>

<p>Spring’s massive <em>Fame Is the Spur</em> (1940) records many of the major
events in English national life in the seventy-five year period ending in
1940. But one of the primary formative influences in John Hamer Shawcross’
life took place forty-six years before he was born. It was the Peterloo
Massacre of 1819, in which the working people gathered in Manchester
to hear Orator Hunt were attacked by dragoons. This story, related by
Hamer’s great uncle, first fires his imagination and then becomes part of
his stock in trade. Entering politics as “Shawcross of Peterloo,” he carries
the sabre which the old man had wrenched from a dragoon. One of the
founders of the Labour Party, Shawcross scorns the Fabians and writes
popular books on politics. In London he sees Keir Hardie take his seat as
one of Labour’s first M.P.’s. Later his marriage is disrupted when his wife
estranges herself from him for his opposition to her suffragist campaigns.
Spring records the turbulence of these efforts&mdash;the pickets outside Parliament,
the violence, the hunger strikes, and the “Cat and Mouse Act” (a
convicted suffragist was placed under police surveillance so that she could
be returned to jail when she appeared to have recovered from the effects
of a hunger strike). Although Shawcross’ part in the World War I coalition
government is considered by many a betrayal of Labour, he becomes
Minister of Ways and Means when Labour comes in again in 1924. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
lost his chance to be Prime Minister, partly because of his stand in 1914,
Shawcross in 1931 puts in motion the formation of the National Labour
Party, intended as part of the coalition which is to be formed to take
measures against the depression. This is thought to be his final betrayal of
the Labour Party and cause. As a reward he is made Viscount Shawcross
of Handforth in the same year. His forty-year political career is at an end.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Joyce Cary: The Edwardian Age and After</b></p>

<p>Tom Wilcher, in Joyce Cary’s <em>To be a Pilgrim</em> (1942), is nearing the
end of a life much involved with politics. In this acute, witty, and compassionate
book, Cary follows Wilcher’s attempt to keep a representative
of the family in Tolbrook, its old home, and to inculcate into his niece and
her little boy the religion which has been so vital a part of his own life.
Through his recollections of his own experience and that of his brother
Edward, Wilcher gives a vivid record of tense moments in England’s
political life. He recalls the stormy days when he and Edward were pro-Boer,
and the more explosive times which followed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are no political battles nowadays to equal the bitterness and fury of those
we fought between 1900 and 1914. It is a marvel to me that there was, after all,
no revolution, no civil war, even in Ireland. For months in the years 1909 and
1910, during the last great battle with the Lords, any loud noise at night, a
banging door, a roll of thunder, would bring me sitting upright in bed, with
sweat on my forehead and the thought, ‘The first bomb&mdash;it has come at last.’</p>
</div>

<p>Ten years later, in <em>Prisoner of Grace</em>, Cary built a novel around the career
of another Labour politician, Chester Nimmo. He secures attention and
injuries through his pro-Boer agitation. Shifting his attack from the
government to the landlords, he finally wins a seat in Parliament in 1902,
later becoming Under Secretary for Mines. He is so intensely political that
when he tells his son fairy tales, the wolf in <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> has
“a face just like Joe Chamberlain.” The narrator, Nimmo’s unhappy wife
Nina, reflects that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I suppose nobody now can realize the effect of that “revolution” on even quite
sensible men.... But the truth is that it was a real revolution. Radical leaders
like Lloyd George ... really did mean to bring in a new kind of state, a “paternal

<p>Like Shawcross, Nimmo stays on in the coalition cabinet of 1914, hoping
to become Prime Minister at the war’s end. But he loses his seat in the
general elections of 1922. At the book’s end he is, like Shawcross, a lord,
but one who looks wistfully from the sidelines upon the struggle in the
political arena.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p>The American political novel does not record changes as broad as those
seen in the English political novel. Some of the reasons for this variance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
are clear. In mid-nineteenth century America, as now, there was no titled
aristocracy, no state church, no narrow and restricted suffrage. Also, there
was no nearby source of revolutionary political thought and action such as
that which troubled James and Conrad. What is perhaps disturbing, however,
is the theme most often treated. If the subject most common in the
English novel is political change or evolution ameliorating injustice, the
one most common in the American political novel is corruption. Nearly
half the American novels considered are written around that theme. They
present a history of political misrule in which one group succeeds another.
After the carpetbaggers, scalawags, and Ku-Kluxers have disappeared, the
bosses who rule by mortgage holdings appear. They are succeeded by the
railroad interests. Utilities groups exercise power and are followed by the
oil interests. In the latest phase, corrupt political power is exercised by
gangsters. Domestic politics are almost always the subject of books appearing
before the 1930s. From this time on, however, the novel becomes increasingly
concerned with foreign ideologies and the role of the United
States in world affairs.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Edgar Lee Masters: Expansion and Conflict</b></p>

<p>Edgar Lee Masters’ <em>Children of the Market Place</em> (1922) takes English-born
James Miles from his immigration to America in 1833 to his dotage in
1900. Despite Miles’s successive activities as farmer, broker, builder, and
real estate operator, his chief function is to chronicle the career of Stephen
A. Douglas. The description of Douglas’ rise is paralleled by an account of
the expansion of the United States. Historical personages pass across the
stage&mdash;Jackson, Clay, Polk, Webster, Calhoun, and Lincoln. The great
issues of the times, such as the tariff and the bank, the Oregon dispute and
the annexation of Texas, contribute to the book’s atmosphere. Miles even
describes the February Revolution in France, and recounts its impact upon
each European country. After describing the founding of the Republican
Party, he gives his eyewitness account of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. The
Civil War is about to set fire to the land, but the main narrative breaks off
at this point. Masters attempted to liven the book by giving Miles an
octoroon half-sister who causes him to commit murder and is herself the
victim of rape and persecution. But the novel’s chief value in a study of this
genre is its attempt to delineate Douglas and his political philosophy against
the background of formative periods in America’s history. The literary debits
include a pell-mell, unconvincing style loaded with rhetorical questions
and overpowering statistics.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Albion Tourgée: Slavery and Emancipation</b></p>

<p>In <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> Harriet Beecher Stowe gave a vivid picture of the
Underground Railway through which slaves escaped to Canada. Among her
characters were abolitionists who aided them and agents hired to recapture
them. The historical aspects of slavery and emancipation were treated more
fully, however, by Albion W. Tourgée. <em>A Fool’s Errand</em> (1879) tells the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
story of a man with the improbable name of Comfort Servosse. A lawyer
and ex-Union officer like Tourgée, he had moved to the South after the
war, as did the author. Referred to by Tourgée as “The Fool,” Servosse attempts
the difficult task of integrating himself and his family into the life
of a Southern community while supporting the rights of the Negroes. His
experience, extending from 1866 until his death in the late seventies, is one
of progressive disillusionment. Thorough analyses of events support the
conclusions he draws. Early in the book one reads a detailed account of
President Johnson’s plan for Negro suffrage and also a statement of the
supplementary Howard Amendment. Having discussed the role of the
secret, pro-North “Union League” in the South during the war, Tourgée
goes on to detail the rise of the Ku-Klux Klan. Later he analyzes the acts
of amnesty passed by some Southern states to protect from prosecution
members of secret organizations such as the Klan. By 1877 the South is in
political control of its land again. Its policy of suppression has succeeded.
This was the fault, Tourgée tells the reader, of stupid and foolish Federal
policies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Reconstruction was never asserted as a right, at least not formally and authoritatively.
Some did so affirm; but they were accounted visionaries. The act
of reconstruction was excused as a necessary sequence of the failure of the
attempted secession: it was never defended or promulgated as a right of the
nation, even to secure its own safety.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1880 Tourgée published <em>Bricks Without Straw</em>, which spanned a short
period before the war as well as that after it. The book follows the career of
a Negro named Nimbus from chattel to landowner. But the novel is no
more a dispenser of sweetness and light than was its predecessor. Nimbus is
driven from his farm by the same forces which had made a Southern home
untenable for Comfort Servosse. The romance between Northern Mollie
Ainslie and Southern Hesden LeMoyne is redolent of tears, misunderstandings,
and pining hearts finally united. In spite of its melodrama and other
nineteenth-century trappings, the book is valuable. The purpose and function
of the Freedmen’s Bureau are examined as well as the Black Codes
which counterbalanced it. Tourgée also discusses at length the township
system installed in the South during the Reconstruction era and its gradual
destruction by totalitarian appointee government on the county level. Near
the novel’s end the reader sees the pitiful plight of Nimbus’ friends victimized
by the Landlord and Tenant Act which strengthened the sharecropper
system and reduced many Negroes to serfdom.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>John W. De Forest: Post-War Corruption</b></p>

<p>In <em>Honest John Vane</em> (1875) and <em>Playing the Mischief</em> (1876) John
W. De Forest built his stories around corruption in post-war Congress.
John Vane goes to Washington with a reputation for honesty. When he
succumbs to his wife’s pressure for money to finance social climbing, he is
more circumspect but just as greedy as his colleagues. His tempter and
mentor is Darius Dorman, called by the author “Satan’s messenger” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
apparently actually meant to be one, complete with smoldering sparks and
the smell of sulphur. He tells Vane not to</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>go into the war memories and the nigger worshipping; all those sentimental
dodges are played out. Go into finance. The great national questions to be attended
to now are the questions of finance. Spread yourself on the tariff, the
treasury, the ways and means, internal improvements, subsidy bills, and relief
bills. Dive into those things, and stick there. It’s the only way to cut a figure in
politics and to make politics worth your while.</p>
</div>

<p>The main character in <em>Playing the Mischief</em> is Josephine Murray, a young
widow who uses her attractiveness to secure passage of a bill which awards
her $60,000 compensation for a barn burned in the War of 1812. In the
process of dealing with lobbyists and corrupting Senators she loses the love
of Edgar Bradford, a stalwart young Congressman who has tried to dissuade
her from her scheme. Rising in the House, he denounces the lobbying and
bribery he sees, declaring that “Congressional legislation will soon become
a synonym for corruption, not only throughout this country, but throughout
the world.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Hamlin Garland: Enter the Farmer</b></p>

<p>Set in Iowa in the 1870s, Hamlin Garland’s <em>A Spoil of Office</em> (1897)
deals with the role of farmers’ organizations in politics. Bradley Talcott,
silent and clumsy but obviously a dark horse who will pay off handsomely,
enters politics because it attracts him and because he wants to better himself
“for her,” as Garland insists on referring to Ida Wilbur. Before they are
married in a haze of romance and comradely devotion to the farmers’ interests,
they work with the Grange and the Farmers’ Alliance. Free trade,
national banks, and woman’s suffrage are discussed frequently, as well as
the depredations of corporations. A sentimental and somewhat superficial
book which substitutes clichés and catch-phrases for exploration in depth
of causes and effects, <em>A Spoil of Office</em> is valuable for its recital of the
farmer’s early role in politics&mdash;if one can bear the surfeit of bucolic virtues
and inarticulate devotion to a fair and exalted lady.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Winston Churchill and David Phillips: Bosses and Lobbies</b></p>

<p>In his “Afterword” to <em>Coniston</em> (1906), Winston Churchill wrote that
“many people of a certain New England state will recognize Jethro Bass.”
But he denied that his book was a biography and added that “Jethro Bass
was typical of his Era, and it is of the era that this book attempts to treat.”
Beginning his story shortly after Andrew Jackson had entered the White
House, Churchill traces Bass’s subsequent control of Coniston, Truro
County, and then of the entire state (probably New Hampshire). His
original lever is a sheaf of mortgages. Through this power over his mortgagers,
he places his men (also mortgage holders) in office and builds his
machine. By 1866 Bass has gained control of the state, which he runs from
his room in the Pelican Hotel in the capital. He has transferred his devotion
from his dead sweetheart, Cynthia Ware, to her child, Cynthia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Wetherell. His chief source of income is the railroad lobby, which pays
handsomely for the legislation it purchases through the state legislature
from him.</p>

<p>When Cynthia leaves him on learning his political methods, the saddened
Bass begins to let his power slip away. The industrial and railroad interests
start to combine while the Harwich bank stands by with mortgage
money to help destroy his control. But Bass returns to fight one more battle
when magnate Isaac Worthington has Cynthia dismissed from her school-teaching
job and disinherits his son Bob for wanting to marry her. Mustering
his power in the legislature and showering Worthington with adverse decisions
from supreme court judges he has made, Bass blocks Worthington’s
railroad consolidation bill. After compelling him to consent to the marriage
and write conciliatory letters to the lovers, Bass lets the bill go through.</p>

<p>In <em>Mr. Crewe’s Career</em> (1908), set twenty years later, Churchill described
the power shift Bass had foreseen. The legislature is now owned by
Augustus Flint, Worthington’s former “seneschal” who controls the Northeastern
Railroad. His “captain-general” who rules from Bass’s old room in
the Pelican is railroad counsel Hilary Vane. The star-crossed lovers in this
novel are Victoria Flint and Austen Vane. Austen fights the railroads
despite his father and foresees the day when a new generation, willing to
assume its political responsibilities, will turn out the railroad group. After a
quarrel, Hilary leaves Flint but agrees to stay on for the gubernatorial
nomination battle. As Flint watches Vane stalk from his study he sees “the
end of an era of fraud, of self-deception, of conditions that violated every
sacred principle of free government which men had shed blood to obtain.”
Out of loyalty to his father, Austen refuses to let his name go before the
convention, but he says that it does not matter, for railroad power is
doomed. The book closes with a purple passage in which Austen and Victoria
tell their love to each other and watch the sunset over the river.</p>

<p>Harvey Sayler relates his rise to boss of the Republican Party in David
Graham Phillips’ <em>The Plum Tree</em> (1905). His springboard is a combine,
financed by a dozen companies forming the Power Trust in his own mid-western
state, which will establish its own control over the state legislature
rather than dealing through middlemen such as Bill Dominick, brutal
saloonkeeper and politician. By placing his own men in key positions and
corporation-control statutes on the state books, Sayler makes the combine
completely his own. After using this combination to ruin a rebellious
“robber baron,” Sayler’s rule is unquestioned. He becomes a president-maker,
later allowing his creature to return to political obscurity as the
price for revolt against his authority. A penitent widower at the book’s
end, he is accepted by his scrupulous childhood sweetheart.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Jack London: Marxism v. Fascism, Early Phase</b></p>

<p>Jack London’s <em>The Iron Heel</em> (1908) is unique for three reasons. It is
one of the first relatively modern American novels which preaches Marxism,
warns against Fascism, and is set in the future. Set in the twenty-seventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
century, four hundred years after the Brotherhood of Man had
overthrown the three-century-old Oligarchy, the novel is the annotated
manuscript of Avis Everhard. The wife of Socialist leader Ernest Everhard,
she is executed with him after the failure of the Second Revolt, which appears
to have occurred sometime after 1918. A revolutionary Socialist,
London attacked the capitalistic system, making its corporations the
founders of the ruthless and repressive Oligarchy. London produces quotations
from Calhoun, Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt warning against the
domination of corporations. He describes the police and strike-breaking
functions of the Pinkertons in their service, specifically names eleven industrial
groups said to dominate the United States in 1907, and chronicles
the efforts of the labor movements for better working conditions. Sometimes
maudlin and at other times vituperative, London nevertheless gives
a frightening vision of a totalitarian state such as that which later became
the actuality described in Silone’s novels of Italy under Mussolini. London
anticipates other novels of this type even in particulars, as in the case of his
“people of the abyss,” who are purposely degraded and brutalized quite as
much as Orwell’s Proles.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>James L. Ford, Samuel H. Adams, and Upton Sinclair: Oil Men and
Anarchists</b></p>

<p>James L. Ford’s <em>Hot Corn Ike</em> (1923) deals with political corruption in
New York City, at the same time harking back through one of its characters
to the Know-Nothing Party and the assassination of Bill Poole. In
1926 Samuel Hopkins Adams’ Revelry moved on to corruption on the
national scene. The novel is a roman à clef whose characters have a one-for-one
correspondence to the real ones in Sinclair’s <em>Oil!</em> Willis Markham is
Warren Harding; Dan Lurcock is Barney Brockway; Anderson Gandy is
Senator Crisby. If the reader likes, he can read the latter as a key to the
former. Sinclair inundates the reader with a detailed account of the corruption
of the Harding era and highlights of the labor movement. He treats the
impact of the Russian Revolution upon America and the political implications
of American troops fighting the Bolsheviks in Siberia. Following the
activities of the I.W.W., he describes the resistance to them which included
such measures as California’s Criminal Syndicalism Act. This big book also
treats, with the solidity Masters probably meant to achieve, an equally
turbulent era in American national development. In Boston Sinclair used
even more documentation to relate what he saw as the struggle between
capital and labor. Through Bartolomeo Vanzetti’s active career and subsequent
struggle for life, the reader meets many of the militant groups in the
labor movement in America during the second and third decades of this
century. The I.W.W. appears again with anarcho-syndicalists, and anarchists.
Sinclair even distinguishes the communisti anarchici from the
anarchico individualista. Although the book’s literary merits are submerged
by the pamphleteering and passion, it is worth reading for the slice of
faintly fictionalized American political history which it presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>John Dos Passos and James T. Farrell: Communist Infiltration</b></p>

<p>Like Steinbeck’s <em>In Dubious Battle</em>, Dos Passos’ <em>Adventures of a Young
Man</em> deals with Communist infiltration of the American labor movement
in the thirties. Giving the reader background material on the militant role
of the I.W.W., both novels follow Communist labor organizers into the
field among migrant agricultural workers, miners, and industrial workers.
Through their characters the novelists reveal not only the immediate goals
of the organizers in terms of wages and working conditions, but also the
place of these struggles in the plan for a socialistic society. Dos Passos goes
even farther in showing the international aspect of these efforts&mdash;the sensitivity
to the Moscow-formed party line, the submergence of local issues in
terms of the overall revolutionary policy.</p>

<p>In 1952 James T. Farrell published a novel which also dealt with Communism
in the mid-thirties. It was <em>Yet Other Waters</em>, the story of Bernard
Carr’s attraction to Marxism and his subsequent break with it. This sometimes
turgid book centers around the relation of the writer to the Communist
movement. Many of the phenomena of the period are there: the
magazines purveying a Marxist interpretation of literature, the writers’
councils and congresses, the attempts to generate a party literature. Never
a member of the Party, Carr is torn between an attraction to its stated aims
and repulsion at its rigid control of thought and art. He joins picket lines,
reads a paper at a Congress, and then sees the Communists turn a Socialist
meeting into a riot. When he breaks with his party friends, he is given “the
treatment.” He is vilified in the left wing papers and reviews as party hacks
make a concerted attempt to destroy his literary reputation. (And, of course,
this attempted destruction of his means of livelihood is the same method
used by the extreme Right to punish political divergency in <em>The Troubled
Air</em> and <em>Stranger Come Home</em>.) Unfortunately, the charge that Farrell has
a tin ear in writing dialogue is true. This long book has a considerable cumulative
effect, but one pays for it by wading through many slow-moving passages.
On the whole, though, it is a convincing portrait in depth, valuable
also for its retroactive anticipation of the so-called “Literature of Disillusionment”
which was to come from such writers as Silone and Koestler.</p>

<p>Like Hemingway’s <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>, Dos Passos’ <em>Adventures of
a Young Man</em> had in its later sections described the fight against Fascism
in the Spanish Civil War. Both novels recorded the infiltration of the
Loyalist forces by the Communists and the supremacy which they achieved
in many sectors. In his next book, <em>Number One</em>, Dos Passos turned his attention
to a source of growing concern to many Americans: dictatorship on
the state level as exemplified by the Long machine in Louisiana. Two other
novels, Adria Locke Langley’s <em>A Lion Is in the Streets</em> (1945) and Robert
Penn Warren’s <em>All the King’s Men</em> (1946), are similar to it, although the
quality of the writing varies greatly. Dos Passos’s style is characteristically
dispassionate and panoramic. Warren’s book, despite devices smacking of
melodrama, has sweep and a highly evocative poetic prose. Langley’s novel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
is full of worn devices: the faithful mammy with the corn-pone accent, the
deathbed message, hidden documents, and a shadowy avenger. But all three
books have their primary historical source in the career of Huey Long or the
forces in American political life which he typified.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Upton Sinclair and John Dos Passos: Global War and Politics</b></p>

<p>In <em>Presidential Agent</em> (1945), as in the rest of the voluminous Lanny
Budd series, Upton Sinclair mixed imaginary characters with real ones, and
fictitious events with those from last year’s newspapers. In this novel (for
which any other of the series might be substituted for the present purpose),
Lanny moves among the great ones of the world as their intimate
and confidant. As Presidential Agent 103 with the code name Zaharoff, he
sends his reports directly to President Roosevelt. Using his entree as an art
expert, he further ingratiates himself into the confidence of the leading
Nazis by becoming Hitler’s <em>Kunstsachverständiger</em>. In this role he goes to
Austria ostensibly to purchase paintings for Hitler but actually to gauge
Austria’s mood and its ripeness for <em>anschluss</em> with Germany. The incredible
Lanny breaks into an SS dungeon, Indian-wrestles with Rudolph Hess,
and briefs everyone about everyone else, from Lord Runciman to Kurt
Schuschnigg. He also finds time to outline Roosevelt’s Chicago “quarantine”
speech. All is revealed to him, from the Cagoulard conspiracy in
France to the temper of the Cliveden set in England. The pages of this
long novel are jammed with events and people who made news on three
continents immediately before and after Munich. A journalistic, omniscient
book, <em>Presidential Agent</em> is loaded with slang, clichés, and gauche conversation
and narration. But it is an outstanding example of the novel which
records current political history.</p>

<p>Dos Passos’s <em>Grand Design</em> pulls together the threads of several current
themes. In this one book, the reader finds a continuation of earlier material
about Communism in America, the rising labor movement, and new liberalism
in government. The transition is then made to World War II, America’s
world responsibilities, growing recognition of the Communist threat,
and American obligations in the post-war world. The novel’s characters
work out their individual destinies against a background of New Deal reforms
and international events leading to war. But there is no arbitrary
interlarding of the two. Dos Passos ably manipulates these two types of
material. He weaves them together into one fabric so that they combine
into a meaningful pattern which sets off individual action against group
action. The NRA, the WPB, the fall of the Low Countries, the agitation
for a second front&mdash;all of them are there. But in this artistic fusion the lives
of Millard Carroll, Paul Graves, and Georgia Washburn remain individual,
retaining their identity and meaning.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Post-War Directions</b></p>

<p>In the post-war years, the American political novel seems to have gone
not in one direction but in three. The first is toward concern for America’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
world role as seen in <em>Grand Design</em>. The second returns to the theme of
corruption. The third leads to an exploration of domestic dangers to traditional
American freedoms. Weller’s <em>The Crack in the Column</em> pursues the
international theme, indirectly indicating, upon the basis of lessons learned
in Greece, the program which has resulted in the building of American
air bases from Spain to Yugoslavia. Weller’s book is also valuable as a
political history of wartime and post-war Greece. Besides the working of
the wartime EAM front, the novel describes the pattern of planned Communist
expansion and Western moves made to counteract it. Gallico’s
<em>Trial by Terror</em>, besides being an instrument for criticism of the foreign
policy which gave no protection to American citizens jailed and tortured
behind the Iron Curtain, also records one tactic of the cold war deliberately
intended to ruin American prestige in Europe.</p>

<p>Three recent novels treat corruption on the local level. They are Charles
Francis Coe’s <em>Ashes</em> (1952), Mary Anne Amsbary’s <em>Caesar’s Angel</em> (1952),
and William Manchester’s <em>The City of Anger</em> (1953). Although the theme
is old, some of the actors are new. The lobbies and trusts have been replaced
by a more sinister operative&mdash;the gangster. And the power behind
the city government is not a single gang led by a “Little Caesar.” In <em>Ashes</em>
it is the Mafia, a transplanted Sicilian terrorist society. In <em>Caesar’s Angel</em>
the ruler is a national syndicate. The hero of <em>Ashes</em> is given a short lecture
on the economics of the ring:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is no longer possible for our interests to keep all their money profitably occupied.
It piles up too fast. It threatens to become visible to the Federal taxing
authorities. We are constantly seeking, and finding, new areas in which to
invest. So-called legitimate areas. It is foolhardy, perhaps, to pay such taxes as
legitimate commerce requires, but our sums are so vast that our interests feel
that they should be converted into capital assets.</p>
</div>

<p>The scale of corruption in Manchester’s book is more modest, for there the
rotten façade has been undermined by a local numbers racket rather than
a national group. The bought politicians are clearly drawn, as are the agents
who subvert them. Once again we are dealing with fiction, but we need
only turn to the findings of state and federal commissions of inquiry to see
the bases in fact. The best of these rather ordinary novels is <em>The City of
Anger</em>. The Freudian critic will be interested in Manchester’s recurrent
images of decay, corruption, and physical filth which may, however, represent
an attempt to buttress stylistically his basic theme of political and
moral corruption. In <em>Caesar’s Angel</em> Mrs. Amsbary’s criminals and police
are terribly hard-boiled but not completely convincing. Although her gangsters
are much better done than Mrs. Langley’s in <em>A Lion Is in the Streets</em>,
she still sounds somehow like a very nice lady trying to be very tough. With
his clipped, repetitive sentences and grim-jawed men, Coe seems to be
suffering from an overdose of Hemingway. Yet at times he manages to go
one hundred and eighty degrees in the opposite direction with dialogue
like this from “Young Tim”: “You alone, Mums, combine such true goodness
of soul with such great understanding of things!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Concern over threats to personal freedom forms the basis for Shaw’s
<em>The Troubled Air</em> and Shirer’s <em>Stranger Come Home</em>. The events and characters
in these novels make it clear that they too have as their starting points
the contemporary history which they cloak in fiction. The blacklists of
Shaw’s book are as real as Shirer’s Senator O’Brien and his Senate Committee
on Security and Americanism. Shirer’s people are taken from contemporary
American life. Across his stage parade General Cyrus Field
Clark, a newspaper chain owner of medieval prejudices and keeper of
faded ex-movie star Madeleine Marlowe; Bert Woodruff, a demented
columnist; William McKinley Forbes, dictatorial tobacco tycoon; and
Senator Reynolds, the committee’s representative from the Old South. The
supporting roles are filled with the same accuracy. They include the professional
ex-Communists and the sharp little committee counsel who puts
loaded questions with ominous mentions of perjury. The commentator’s
radio career is destroyed like that of his Foreign Service friend, although
both are innocent men. Shirer ranges far afield, from comments upon similar
periods of “hysteria” in American history to Hollywood’s refusal to film
<em>Hiawatha</em> because his “peace efforts might be regarded as Red propaganda.”
The plight of Whitehead is well imagined, but the book’s diary form is not
a particularly happy choice and much of its prose is awkward. As a record of
the source of some of the most spectacular domestic news of recent years,
however, the novel is worth reading.</p>

<p>Mailer’s <em>Barbary Shore</em>, which is not a part of any of the three post-war
trends, displays the novelist’s function as a historian in its retelling of the
story of the Russian Revolution. A twenty-page account and eulogy are
followed by a description of the revolution’s failure to spread and its consequent
nationalization. Lovett also recounts his discipleship under Trotsky
before he goes on to list the forces which created a police state instead of a
promised land.</p>


<p class="p2 big1 center">THE CONTINENT AND ELSEWHERE</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Joseph Conrad: Colonial Politics and Revolution</b></p>

<p>Joseph Conrad’s <em>Nostromo</em> (1904) may be read as a history if one interprets
it as a typical case of government-making by foreign industrial interests
in late-nineteenth-century South America. With the American Holroyd
as his silent partner and financial backer, British-educated Charles Gould
uses the wealth of his San Tomas silver mine to finance the successful revolt
of Occidental Province from the Republic of Costaguana, which is in the
grip of the tyrannical Montero brothers. A good deal of actual history is
injected through the reminiscences of old Giorgio Viola, who had fought
under Garibaldi across South America to Italy. But it was in <em>The Secret
Agent</em> and <em>Under Western Eyes</em> that Conrad recorded more memorable
history. Both books give extensive accounts of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary
activities. A superb artist, Conrad did not need to go to a
series of actual events and people. His imaginative synthesis of the factors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
which produce them created, however, a true pattern of this whole complex
of revolutionary activity. Besides the sensitive exploration of the characters
of Razumov, Nathalia, and Victorovitch, one finds actions which characterized
the movement in which they were swept up. Conrad presents the
espionage and counter-espionage, the bomb plots, and the abortive revolts.
Though he wrote out of revulsion at revolutionary activity, his point of view
did not blind him to the miseries of Czarist Russia. With artistic integrity,
he described the repressive commissions, their imprisonments, exiles, and
executions. His account of the fate of Mikulin, chief of Czarist counter-espionage,
makes extremely interesting reading in 1954. For Mikulin one
could almost substitute Koestler’s Rubashov:</p>



<p class="blockquot">Later on, the larger world first heard of him in the very hour of his downfall,
during one of those State trials which astonish and puzzle the average man who
reads the newspapers by a glimpse of unsuspected intrigues. And in the stir of
vaguely seen monstrosities, in that momentary, mysterious disturbance of muddy
waters, Councilor Mikulin went under, dignified, with only a calm, emphatic
protest of his innocence&mdash;nothing more. No disclosures damaging to a harassed
autocracy, complete fidelity to the secret of the miserable <em>arcana imperii</em>, deposited
in his patriotic breast a display of bureaucratic stoicism in a Russian
official’s ineradicable, almost sublime contempt for truth; stoicism of silence
understood only by very few of the initiated, and not without a certain cynical
grandeur of self-sacrifice on the part of a Sybarite. For the terribly heavy sentence
turned Councilor Mikulin civilly into a corpse, and actually into something very
much like a common convict.</p>

<p class="blockquot">It seems that the savage autocracy, any more than the divine democracy, does
not limit its diet exclusively to the bodies of its enemies. It devours its friends
and servants as well.</p>



<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Soviet State: Its Roots and Growth</b></p>

<p>It was this same Czarist Russia of which Turgenev wrote in <em>Fathers and
Sons</em>. Examining Nihilism, he also looked at contemporary events such as
the emancipation of serfs and the attempts of some landowners to improve
the lot of their workers despite agrarian disturbances. Violently anti-revolutionary,
Dostoyevsky replied in <em>The Possessed</em> to what appeared to him to
be Turgenev’s advocacy of revolution. In his massive and powerful novel
he showed the agitation produced by groups such as the “quintets” organized
by Pyotr Verhovensky, themselves the forerunners of the Communist
cells.</p>

<p>In Koestler’s <em>Darkness at Noon</em> Dostoyevsky’s nightmare becomes an
even more terrible actuality. In his introductory note Koestler writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The characters in this book are fictitious. The historical circumstances which
determined their actions are real. The life of the man N. S. Rubashov is a
synthesis of the lives of a number of men who were victims of the so-called
Moscow Trials. Several of them were personally known to the author. This book
is dedicated to their memory.</p>

<p>Through flashbacks the reader sees Stalin, Lenin, and the members of the
First International Congress. Not only does he witness the breaking of
Rubashov for his trial, but also the series of cold and merciless acts of expediency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
which have eroded the soul of the old Bolshevik and left him
ready for his final service to the Party. Koestler describes the agonizing
process by which the confession is extracted. Gletkin, his interrogator, supplies
the rationale for the whole performance and for most of the repressive
acts of the state as well. In some ways, Rubashov is reminiscent of Trotsky,
with his pince-nez, his record as a commander in the Revolution, his extensive
service outside Russia, and his onetime rank as a top Communist.
(A closer resemblance to Trotsky is that of the Party’s fictitious scapegoat
in 1984. Emmanuel Goldstein, with his fuzzy hair and small goatee, is the
arch counter-revolutionary, the author of <em>The Theory and Practice of
Oligarchical Collectivism</em>.) <em>Darkness at Noon</em> is a stark and brilliant book.
Artistically satisfying, it also presents a record of a characteristic phenomenon
of Russian Communism.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Marie-Henri Beyle [Stendhal]: Napoleonic Panorama</b></p>

<p>Thirty-nine years after he followed Napoleon’s armies into Italy, Stendhal
published a sweeping novel of that era. <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> follows
the career of Fabrizio Valserra, Marchesino del Dongo, from birth to death.
It shows the influence upon his life of his beautiful, devoted, and scheming
aunt, the Contessa Gina Pietranera. We meet her lover, Conte Mosca della
Rovere Sorezana, Minister to Prince Ernesto IV of Parma and politician
extraordinary, and become privy to the intrigues of the court. This large
novel is crammed with incident&mdash;duels, assignations, affairs, prison-breaks,
and even the assassination of a monarch. Besides all this, Stendhal relates
some of the major events in French and Italian history during nearly thirty
years. In particular, we see Napoleon’s triumphal entries into Italy in 1796,
1801, and 1815. Fabrizio even participates on the fringes of the battle of
Waterloo. With each arrival and departure, Napoleon’s adherents and
those of the Austrian Emperor play musical chairs for the positions of
power. Even after Napoleon has been banished to Elba a struggle goes on
between Liberals (or Jacobins) and the proponents of absolute monarchy.
The Liberal cause is perverted in Parma by the rascally General Fabio
Conti, who ironically serves as Ernesto’s political jailer, but the temper of
this movement in Europe is reflected in the thoughts and actions of many
of the characters. Describing authoritarian government and the struggles
against it, as well as the interrelation of a corrupt church and a corrupt
state, Stendhal’s classic successfully fuses the lives of his people with the
times in which they lived.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>André Malraux: Comintern v. Kuomintang</b></p>

<p>Nearly a hundred years later André Malraux wrote of a time of political
chaos in <em>Man’s Fate</em>. But the span of his novel was four months rather than
thirty years. Malraux gives a detailed account of Chiang Kai-shek’s military
victory of 1927 in Shanghai and his subsequent crushing of the Chinese
Communist forces which fought him. Not only does he examine the roles
of the immediate participants&mdash;the White Guards, the governmental army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the “Reds” and “Blues” of the Kuomintang&mdash;but also the intervention of
outside forces as well&mdash;the Russian Communists, the Shanghai bankers,
the French Chamber of Commerce, and the Franco-Asiatic Consortium.
Malraux explores both the military and economic aspects of the struggle.
Kyo Gisors feels that triumph here will mean “the U.S.S.R. increased to
six hundred million men.” Ferral, head of the Chamber and the Consortium,
realizes that it will also mean the end of his group’s commercial
penetration of the Yangtze basin. <em>Man’s Fate</em> may be read for these insights
into the uprising of 1927 and also for background on the formulation of the
Communist decision which kept the armies of Mao Tse-tung, Chu Teh,
and others within the Kuomintang until they gained enough strength to
defeat it.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Jean-Paul Sartre: The Shadow of Munich</b></p>

<p>Jean-Paul Sartre’s technique in <em>The Reprieve</em> (1947) may remind one of
a photographer whose camera mechanism has gone awry. What he is trying
to do is clear, but it does not quite come off. Covering the week of September
23-30, 1938, the novel is kaleidoscopic. Using more than nine distinct
couples or groups, Sartre jumps from the activities of one to another
with no transition. The scene may change from sentence to sentence or
even within a sentence. He obviously does this to portray events which are
happening simultaneously. He also uses this technique, apparently, to give
some sense of the chaos that reigned during the week when Europe was
on the verge of war. To show the impact of these events upon France, he
has selected his people from many strata of French society. Interspersed
between all these semi-fragmented stories and incidents are dialogues between
the politicians: Hitler and his aides, Daladier and Bonnet, Chamberlain
and Halifax, Sir Nevile Henderson and Sir Horace Wilson. Through its
characters the novel ranges over Europe from England to the Sudetenland,
finally arriving at Munich. The book’s last two paragraphs serve as an example
of this technique which has a cumulative effect but which can be
extremely troublesome to a reader accustomed to conventional narration.
Daladier’s plane lands at Le Bourget as Milan Hlinka, a loyal Sudeten
Czech, hears of his country’s dismemberment:</p>

<p class="blockquot">A vast clamor greeted [Daladier], the crowd surged through the cordon of
police and swept the barriers away; Milan drank and said with a laugh: “To
France! To England! To our glorious allies!” Then he flung the glass against the
wall; they shouted: “Hurrah for France! Hurrah for England! Hurrah for peace!”
They were carrying flags and flowers. Daladier stood on the top step and looked
at them dumbfounded. Then he turned to Leger and said between his teeth:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The God-damned fools!”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Fascism through Italian Eyes</b></p>

<p>Collectively, the novels of Ezio Taddei, Alberto Moravia, and Ignazio
Silone present a history of Italy during the years that saw Mussolini’s rise,
reign, and ruin. Taddei’s <em>The Pine Tree and the Mole</em> (1945) is set in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Livorno in 1919. On one social level the novel follows the career of Michele
Pellizari, whose political odyssey leads him from the Italian Socialist Party
to the Fascist Party, and eventually to a return to the land of his peasant
people. On another level the novel relates the rise of Rubachiuchi from jailbird
to Fascist agent provocateur and party official. There are many long
passages throughout the book in which Taddei drops his characters to go
directly to a recital of the events which led to the triumph of the Fascists.
He describes the return of war veterans filled with unrest and plagued with
unemployment. He records the failure of the Socialists as the Fascists
deliberately fill their Black Shirt squads with convicted criminals. He
sets down the workers’ capture of the factories and finally the Fascist march
on Rome.</p>

<p>In <em>The Conformist</em> (1951) Alberto Moravia is more concerned with a
psychological portrait of Marcello Clerici than he is with the description
of the period. But in analyzing the trauma-inspired desire for conformity
which led to his job in Mussolini’s secret police, Moravia tells a good deal
about the political climate of Italy of yesterday&mdash;from the palmy days of the
Ethiopian campaign to the time of the retribution which leaves Marcello
and his family dead by the roadside from the bullets of a strafing Allied
plane.</p>

<p>Three of Ignazio Silone’s powerful novels, <em>Fontamara</em>, <em>Bread and Wine</em>,
and <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em>, deal with Italian political history from the
middle thirties to the years immediately following World War II. Writing
from exile when the Fascists were in power, Silone consistently dealt with
the repression of the Italian peasant. Although he always focuses on small
places such as Fontamara, Pietrasecca, and San Luca, his characters are in a
sense generic, representing the non-Fascists who want only enough bread
and wine to live life decently with a little comfort and security. Silone
describes the regimentation of Italian life in the city as well as the village.
He also shows, as does Koestler in <em>Darkness at Noon</em>, the destruction of the
Communist Party after the rise to power of a dictatorship of the Right.
<em>A Handful of Blackberries</em> has as its background the resurgence of the
Italian Communist Party after the fall of Mussolini. But Silone preserves a
continuity with his earlier books by a continuing account of the struggle of
the peasants against the landed families. In this book the Tarocchi family is
the equivalent of Prince Torlonia in Fontamara. Fascism has been crushed,
but the great landowner is still the force which the peasant must fight to
keep his small plot.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Alan Paton: The Trek of the Boers</b></p>

<p>Alan Paton’s <em>Cry, the Beloved Country</em> and <em>Too Late the Phalarope</em> detail
the bases of South Africa’s explosive contemporary political life. The
anti-Negro legislation, the segregation, the police control of the native
peoples are all set forth. Paton’s moving novels record the individual
tragedies which transpire in this climate of tears and violence. They also
show their historical antecedents. The red flashes which Pieter Van<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Vlaanderen wore on his shoulders during the war meant that he would
fight anywhere in Africa. To some this made him</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a Smuts man, a traitor to the language and struggle of the Afrikaner people,
and a lickspittle of the British Empire and the English King, fighting in an
English war that no true Afrikaner would take part in.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is a historical fact that illustrates the division between the peoples of
South Africa. Another is the Immorality Act of 1927, which typifies another
great source of conflict and causes Pieter’s ruin.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Richard Kaufmann: The Third Reich</b></p>

<p>Richard Kaufmann’s <em>Heaven Pays No Dividends</em> (1951) is one of the
better books to come out of post-war Germany although it is not, as its
cover enthusiastically declares, the “modern <em>All Quiet on the Western
Front</em>.” Roderich Stamm is a completely non-political young art historian
who drifts into Nazi organizations because life is made rather unpleasant
for one outside them. His father, however, is an economist who becomes
attracted to the Nazi movement, lectures at meetings, and eventually rises
to an important post in Hitler’s Foreign Ministry. As a gunner in a flak
battery, Stamm fights in France, Russia, and Germany. He emerges from
the war minus several teeth, an arm, and all his illusions. Each of the girls
he has loved has married or died. Through his eyes the reader sees the
events leading to victory in Paris and defeat on the road from Stalingrad.
But one also meets Gestapo men like Alfred Karawan and officials like
Heinrich Himmler. This novel chronicles the sound and fury of politics
and war as it explores the effects on the German people of the rise and
fall of the Third Reich. Less political than most novels in this study, Kaufmann’s
book has a good deal in common with many of them. The lives of
its people are played out against a backdrop of local, national, and international
affairs. And the novelist records not only the comings and goings
of the individuals he creates, but also the events of the world in which they
live.</p>

The Novel as Mirror of National Character</h2>
</div>




<p>A political novel invariably reveals the attitude of its author toward the
national groups from which its characters come. Often the author may
seek to draw a national portrait by describing political behavior which he
believes is peculiarly characteristic of Spaniards or Greeks or Englishmen.
Two novels which thus portray the Russians are <em>Under Western Eyes</em>
and <em>The Possessed</em>. The reader may work with a body of novels which
do not deliberately attempt to delineate national character, and yet he will
still arrive at some conception of national behavior patterns. He can do
this by assessing the subjects treated. If most of the novels deal with
underground activities, coups d’état, or revolutions, he is justified in assuming
that this is a people which takes its politics seriously, and emotionally.
If most of the novels concern parliamentary give and take, clever
use of rules, strategic marches and countermarches, he has a right to conclude
that this national group has achieved some degree of political
sophistication. In dealing with the American novel one has to draw conclusions
in this way. There is a great deal of close attention to tactical and
strategic moves, but there is not too much scrutiny of larger behavior
patterns. The appraiser must use whatever materials seem capable of
giving insight: detailed discussion which is precisely in point, a recurrent
basic situation, or a group of themes whose frequency of appearance is a
good indication of their importance and relevance.</p>

<p>Enough American and English novels are included here to justify drawing
some conclusions. Some of the other national literatures discussed,
however, are represented by relatively few books. Since they constitute a
small sample, one can draw only tentative conclusions. But almost all these
novels are by very talented writers whose work is considered representative
of the best in this genre within their national literatures. They are novels
which offer skilled portrayals of life by artists entitled to a hearing on their
own merits. In order to extract as much from the novel as possible in this
area, comments on nations have been accepted from foreigners where they
seem valid.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">GREAT BRITAIN: A SELF-PORTRAIT</p>

<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Peaceful Change in the Political Realm</b></p>

<p>The English political novel presents a people whose political processes
have operated in a well-defined manner with progressively decreasing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
violence. England had its Wars of the Roses and its Cavaliers and Roundheads,
but with the exception of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1746, resort
to arms as a means of domestic change has been in the discard for the
past two hundred years of English history. The Peterloo Massacre, the
Chartist Riots, and the struggle against the Lords all involved bloodshed,
but this form of conflict has largely subsided. The novel reflects this pattern.
It is one of change within a framework of relative stability. The Right
wing and the Left are the two poles between which the political ions flow.
The names of the poles may vary, as may some of the elements in their
chemical composition, but their function remains the same. The Tory is
always the opponent of change or the advocate of slow and minimal change;
the Whig, Liberal, Fabian, or Labourite is the champion of more rapid
and extensive change. The extreme radical appears occasionally, the revolutionary
infrequently. Almost all the English novels in this study show this
basic alignment. Even when the liberals are represented by Mrs. Ward’s
Venturists and the conservatives by Disraeli’s Young Englanders or Wells’s
New Tories, this is the essential political structure. George Eliot’s Felix
Holt and Harold Transóme, both Radicals, are set off against the Debarry
family headed by Parson Jack and Sir Maximus Debarry. Meredith’s Nevil
Beauchamp is another young Radical in conflict with his uncle Everard
Romfrey, who calls himself a Whig but is an aristocratic reactionary. Except
for Disraeli, James, and Conrad, the authors of these novels tend to
present the case of the liberal or progressive. But no matter what the point
of view or time, the main characters tend to range themselves on one of
these two sides.</p>

<p>Conrad’s <em>The Secret Agent</em> departs from the common liberal-conservative
alignment by dealing with the dangerous lunatic fringe of English political
life&mdash;the revolutionary terrorists. But Verloc, the novel’s main character,
and Yundt, one of the most violent members of the circle, are not native
Englishmen. In using these characters, Conrad views the same political
virtues the other novelists treat by contrasting them with violence. When
the embassy secretary orders Verloc to blow up the Greenwich Observatory,
he tells him that the English must be shocked into repressive action. “This
country,” he says, “is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual
liberty.” The Professor, “The Perfect Anarchist,” attempts to goad Police
Inspector Heat into seizing him when they meet in an alley. Heat knows
that if he does so the Professor will blow both of them up by pressing
the detonator in his pocket. Undoubtedly this fact crosses his mind, but
his answer is typical: “If I were to lay my hand on you now I would be
no better than yourself.”</p>

<p>The Englishman’s often unemotional approach to politics also appears
in the novels. In <em>The New Machiavelli</em>, Dick Remington, enthusiastic about
Socialism and “the working-man,” is one of a group of students who invite
Chris Robinson, “the Ambassador of the Workers,” to Cambridge to talk
to them. But when Robinson speaks, they are disappointed at the excess
of emotion and deficiency of content. When the Englishman does allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
emotion to surge into his politics, it may be mixed with religion. It was said
of Hamer Shawcross, in <em>Fame Is the Spur</em>, that “his platform manner was
that of a revivalist parson.” Chester Nimmo has somewhat the same style
in <em>Prisoner of Grace</em>. A former Wesleyan lay-preacher, he advocates pacifism
at one point in his career. His wife Nina comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>to a man like Chester, whose politics were mixed up with religion and whose
religion was always getting into his politics, this was the situation which he was
accustomed to handle. It did not prevent his religion from being “true” that he
knew how to “use” it.</p>
</div>

<p>Both these politicians are liberals, and perhaps this is merely another means
of separating the two great groups. The university man, who has had some
advantages, may look upon emotionalism as bad form; the working man,
for whom grade school and the church often constitute his only sources
of formal education, is conditioned to respond to the stimuli he has known
in one of these institutions: the emotional approach of the revivalist parson
or the lay preacher.</p>

<p>Despite the reaction of the aristocrats to this lower group, some of the
English novelists regard them as a great source of national strength. Disraeli
may have felt that they needed guidance, not freedom and self-expression;
Orwell found hope in them. Looking out the window of his and Julia’s
rendezvous, Winston Smith sees the figure of a woman of the Proles, a
“solid, unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing,
toiling from birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty loins a
race of conscious beings must one day come.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Fruits of Imperialism</b></p>

<p>When one thinks of the literature of imperialism he is likely to remember
Kipling’s <em>Soldiers Three</em>, <em>Mandalay</em>, or <em>Recessional</em>. Wells’s Dick Remington
remarks, “The prevailing force in my undergraduate days was not
Socialism but Kiplingism.” But if Kipling emphasizes the White Man’s
Burden, most other novelists emphasize the White Man’s Guilt. In <em>Beauchamp’s
Career</em> Col. Halkett looks up from his newspaper to remark to
Nevil, “There’s an expedition against the hill-tribes in India, and we’re
a peaceful nation, eh? We look as if we were in for a complication with
China.” And Nevil replies ironically, “Well, sir, we must sell our opium.”
Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em> lays prime responsibility for India’s tragedy at
Britain’s doorstep. He pictures the cruel clannishness and snobbery of the
English colony of Chandrapore with its Mrs. Callendar who declares,
“Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die.” India
is full of red-faced Ronny Heaslops, officials who play God, a god whose
thunderbolts and lightnings are infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Mrs. Moore,
the single English subject in Chandrapore able to bridge the enormous gap
between the two cultures, reflects about Ronny:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One touch of regret&mdash;not the canny substitute but the true regret from the
heart&mdash;would have made him a different man, and the British Empire a different
institution.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>There is no question in this novel that Britain is the violator in this loveless
union. The South African novels recall Wordsworth’s line about the
makers of the French Revolution “become oppressors in their turn.” The
Afrikaners may now be the malefactors; at one time they, like the Indians,
were clearly the victims. Jakob Van Vlaanderen, the great stern patriarch
of <em>Too Late the Phalarope</em>, recalls the trek into the interior to escape the
repressive measures of the British. Jim Latter in <em>Prisoner of Grace</em> travels
to London from Nigeria, where he has overseen the destinies of a tribe for
years, because he is convinced that the people in the Colonial Office “want
to kill off the Lugas.”</p>

<p>As Britain began to exchange the imperialist role for that of co-defender
of the West, this deftness and high-handedness in international affairs was
sometimes regarded as an asset. Major Walker assesses it for Tommy McPhail
in <em>The Crack in the Column</em> when he says, “You’re no match for
us in arranging a chain of political events, in planning several moves ahead,
in making the baby be born exactly when the horoscope says, sex, weight,
and appearance of innocence guaranteed.”</p>

<p>Like any good national literature, the English turns inward the searching
light of criticism. The reader sees hypocrites, time-servers, and turncoats.
Spread before him are domestic abuses and cold imperialism. But he is also
given a glimpse of a people who retain a regard for the rights and dignity of
the individual, a people who have turned away from violence and shown
a remarkable capacity for achieving change without sacrificing stability, for
combining growth with order.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">THE UNITED STATES: A SELF-PORTRAIT</p>

<p>De Forest, in <em>Playing the Mischief</em>, describes Congressman Sykes Drummond
as a “Robert-the-Devil” type. This complete cynic makes an interesting
comment on the conditions around him: “A John Bull told me
yesterday that there is no such thing known in England as a municipal
ring or a thieving mayor. That is what any American of the present day
would set down as a fairy story.” If the political novel has any validity as
a commentary on national characteristics, one conclusion is inescapable:
many Americans become criminals when they accept public office. Drummond’s
comment is borne out by the two groups of novels. In the English
novel individuals such as Hamer Shawcross and Chester Nimmo sell out
to the opposition. Nimmo even engages in commercial activities too closely
related to his official duties to be quite proper. But there is a complete
absence of the corruption portrayed at all levels of government in the
American political novel.</p>

<p>Crawford attempted to differentiate the English from the American early
in <em>An American Politician</em>. The novel’s political naïveté renders any of its
judgments suspect, but in this Crawford appears to come close to the
truth. His opinion is that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>English people ... love to associate with persons of rank and power from a
disinterested love of these things themselves, whereas in most other countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the society of notable and influential persons is chiefly sought from the most
cynical motives of personal advantage.... But politics in England and politics
in America, so far as the main points are concerned, are as different as it is
possible for any two social functions to be. Roughly, Government and the doings
of Government are centripetal in England, and centrifugal in America. In
England the will of the people assists the working of Providence, whereas in
America, devout persons pray that Providence may on occasion modify the will
of the people. In England men believe in the Queen, the Royal Family, the
Established Church, and Belgravia first, and in themselves afterwards. Americans
believe in themselves devoutly, and a man who could “establish” upon them a
church, a royalty, or a peerage, would be a very clever fellow.</p>
</div>

<p>His diagnosis of cynicism and self-interest as leading American characteristics
is echoed in the other novels. Good politicians do appear, but for
every Lincoln there are ten Boss Tweeds. Henry Adams’ <em>Democracy</em> also
contains passages in which American political life is compared unfavorably
with that of England. Madeleine Lee attends an immensely boring White
House reception. Not only are the guests dull, but to her the President
and his wife appear as automatons aping royalty.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Forces of Corruption</b></p>

<p>Complete responsibility for corruption does not always rest with the
politician. Some office holders, like Honest John Vane, sincerely try to
stay clean. The corrupt politician usually has a collaborator in the person
of the man who buys him. In Garland’s <em>A Spoil of Office</em> Bradley Talcott’s
illusions are shattered in the legislature and in Congress. Looking around
him he finds that “to rob the commonwealth was a joke.” State legislatures
are often described as assemblages of brigands. The “Woodchuck Session”
of the legislature in Coniston is arrant banditry, and the ones in <em>The
Plum Tree</em> and <em>Mr. Crewe’s Career</em> are only a little less obvious. The industrialist
is usually co-villain with his politician hireling. When he does
not appear in person, he is represented by his middleman, the professional
lobbyist. The lobbyist’s unscrupulous use of his trusting wife is the subject
of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s <em>Through One Administration</em> (1914). Jacob
Pike, in <em>Playing the Mischief</em>, regards the institution with pride:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From his point of view, it was a kind of public life; it was more completely
“inside politics” than even electioneering or legislation; it was, as he believed,
the very germ and main-spring of statesmanship. A leading lobbyist knew exactly
how the world is governed, and for what purpose....</p>
</div>

<p>This whole aspect of the American governmental process in the novel is a
very unsavory one. The industrialists are predatory robber barons who purchase
dishonest politicians in order to obtain special privilege. In <em>The
Charterhouse of Parma</em> the Contessa dissuades Fabrizio from going to
America by explaining to him “the cult of the god <em>Dollar</em>.” In several of
his novels Sinclair declares that American foreign policy has been determined
by the industrial interests. He portrays Dollar Diplomacy with a
vengeance. In <em>Oil!</em> he contends that the United States joined with Britain
and France to fight the Bolsheviks not because of political ideology, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
because “the creditor nations meant to make an example of Soviet Russia,
and establish the rule that a government which repudiated its debts would
be put out of business.” He also tells the reader that the same oil interests
which backed Harding had turned in and out of office a succession of
Mexican governments to suit their own commercial purposes. And it is not
hard to see in <em>Nostromo</em> the influence of the American tycoon Holroyd at
work when the American cruiser <em>Powhatan</em> appears to salute the Occidental
flag and “put an end to the Costaguana-Sulaco War.”</p>

<p>If the perverters of power are not demagogues with messianic complexes,
they may be gangsters who rule by ballots when bribery fails. These subjects
in the novel did not go out of vogue with the Muckraking Era or with
Prohibition. A new rash of novels about gangsters in politics has appeared
in recent years. The gunman who is concerned about investing his money
may be replacing the one who writes his name with machine gun bullets,
but his influence in politics is the same.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The American Idealist</b></p>

<p>The reverse side of this particular coin shows the idealist at work. He
may come out of the political wringer with his ideals mangled and his illusions
full of holes, but still he retains something of the impulse which
created the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Millard
Carroll in <em>The Grand Design</em> is such a one, but he emerges as an old man
at the end of his ordeal. Nick Burr in Ellen Glasgow’s <em>The Voice of the
People</em> (1900) is another, but his end is violent death. In recent years this
idealistic aspect of the American political character has often found expression
in heroes who engage in the direct struggle for liberty. Both Robert
Jordan and Glenn Spotswood spill their blood on Spanish earth fighting
against Franco. Were it not for the crusading district attorneys of books
such as <em>Ashes</em> and <em>Caesar’s Angel</em>, the implication would be that the American
girds on his armor abroad but avoids conflict in his own back yard.
Even so, something of this impression may remain with the reader.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Responsibility at Home and Abroad</b></p>

<p>The pattern in which a nation allows its liberties to be subverted and destroyed
is a familiar one. It is often thought that certain peoples, like the
Germans and Russians, are more susceptible to authoritarianism than
others. One stereotype of the American&mdash;descendant of Minute Men, the
man who hates cops, the fan who cherishes his right to boo the umpire&mdash;has
contributed to the impression that this submissiveness to authority has
never been a part of the American character. Lewis’s <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em>,
Dos Passos’s <em>District of Columbia</em>, and the novels about dictators in southern
states raise some doubts about the validity of this fundamental assumption.
Each of these novelists seems to feel that the American citizen could
well wake up one morning to find his rights gone as did the German citizen
of the early thirties. Lewis dramatizes this catastrophe on a national scale,
while Dos Passos, Warren, and Langley present it on the state level. Dos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Passos, all through his trilogy, writes such frequent exhortations to vigilance
that there is little doubt that he too has worries on this score. In <em>Stranger
Come Home</em> Shirer centers his fire on McCarthyism, but he also goes back
into history to recall the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts and the
domestic anti-German violence of World War I. The popular press and
magazines may represent the American as one who hearkens to the great
voices on each Fourth of July and understands what he is doing when he
raises his banner on Flag Day. The novelist often has serious doubts that
he does.</p>

<p>Europeans have called the United States immature in world affairs. At
least one of the novels in this group examines this accusation, and two others
consider the same theme of irresponsibility on the national level. In both
<em>A Fool’s Errand</em> and <em>Bricks Without Straw</em> Tourgée accused the federal
government of irresponsibility. There is a close parallel between this case
and the one Europeans have made. Pursuing an ideal, at least in part, the
United States musters its enormous industrial and economic potential, puts
its great strength into the field, and wins military victory. After talking a
great deal about what should be done, it sets up committees which write
many reports. Then the nation promptly forgets the problems of victory
and happily returns to consideration of the tariff question or who is going
to win the World Series. In the latter of his two books, Tourgée writes that
the Northern statesmen and political writers seemed always to assume that
the destruction of slavery would cure all the ills of the Negro. With a
typical flourish, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Nation gave the jewel of liberty into the hands of the [Negroes], armed
them with the weapons of self-government, and said: “Ye are many; protect
what ye have received.” Then it took away its hand, turned away its eyes, closed
its ears to every cry of protest or of agony, and said: “We will not aid you nor
protect you. Though you are ignorant, from you we will demand works of wisdom.
Though you are weak, great things shall be required at your hands.” Like
the ancient taskmaster, the Nation said: “<em>There shall no straw be given you,
yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Nearly seventy years later, in <em>The Crack in the Column</em>, Weller said
virtually the same thing. But this time both the problem and the stakes
were global.</p>

<p>The picture of American politics which emerges from the political novel
is an unflattering one. Although the “smoke-filled room” may be a cliché
in the newspapers, it is a fact in the novel. The deck of candidates is
shuffled, cut, and dealt&mdash;often from the bottom. The national conventions
are a combination of circus spectacle and cynical chicanery. And after campaigns
financed by funds from special interest groups, the people’s chosen
representatives get down to the serious business of paying off their debts
while lining their pockets. The crusaders for liberty and justice who appear
can be set off against these political liabilities. But the electorate in whose
behalf they struggle often seems unaware of the importance of the fight.
Inheritors of a tradition of dissent and individual freedom, they are fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
game for demagogues. They are also easy marks for the revolutionaries who,
for perverted purposes, exploit their sincere but naïve desire for social and
economic reform. Although the Republic somehow seems to weather periods
of internecine violence and reversion to authoritarian rule, its citizens
have a bad case of myopia in the field of foreign affairs. There are indications,
though, that the corrective lenses bought in two world wars are beginning
to bring distant events into focus. The American novelist’s view
of his own political arena agrees surprisingly well with many foreign estimates
of it. The American seems like an immature giant who tolerates
much rough behavior but rushes into conflict when he feels that his basic
security is threatened. Now the giant seems to be settling down. Still likely
to make violent moves, he is acquiring some of the political sophistication
that was, perhaps, too early expected of him.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">ITALY: A SELF-PORTRAIT</p>

<p>After a quarrel with Jean Colbert, Tony Maggiore in <em>Caesar’s Angel</em> berates
her friend Al Piazza: “You talk so big about it making no difference
between American and Italian girls. You ever hear a good Italian girl open
her mouth about politics? You hear her insulting the men?” This assertion
is contradicted by Stella in Silone’s <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em>, but even
were it completely true, it would be one of the minor differences between
American and Italian political behavior patterns. Immensely different historical
antecedents separate the two peoples. The Italian, with a background
of autocratic rule except for comparatively short intervals, has
played his political role on a far different stage from that of the American.
But there is more to it than just politics. The economic bases which help
to form political groups have produced in Italy a stratification in which the
layers are more widely separated than any in America. The migrant fruit
pickers, the dust-blown Okies, the exploited miners in America seem well
off beside the systematically persecuted peasants and submerged city
<em>lumpenproletariat</em> of Italy. The Italians at the other end of the scale are just
as far from the norm. Gould, Fisk, and Vanderbilt may have owned railroads,
but Prince Torlonia owns immense ranges of the Roman and Tuscan
countryside, together with 35,000 acres of the Fucino basin worked by
eleven thousand farmers. But this great gulf between classes is only one of
the factors which appear responsible for Italy’s political ills.</p>

<p>Silone concentrates mainly upon the peasantry in his novels. His heart is
close to them, and his description is sympathetic. But he does more than
set forth their sufferings. His books also diagnose the cause of their problems
and suggest solutions. Many of his peasants appear like credulous,
superstitious children. The four-day thunder and lightning storm which
nearly sweeps Pietrasecca off its mountain in <em>Bread and Wine</em> is blamed
upon two lovers who have gone to live in a house considered damned. Don
Paolo watches the gathering of a crowd which is swept into such a hysteria
by its roar of “CHAY DOO! CHAY DOO! CHAY DOO!” that it forgets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to listen to the oracular radio voice it has come to hear. Silone pities them:
“a people whose wisdom was summed up in a few proverbs passed down
from generation to generation, had been literally submerged and overwhelmed
by propaganda.” Don Paolo also blames this ignorance upon the
Church in Italy. Like his teacher Don Benedetto, who was said to have
called the reigning pontiff “Pope Pontius XI,” Don Paolo feels that Italy
needs</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Christianity denuded of all mythology, of all theology, of all Church control;
a Christianity that neither abdicates in the face of Mammon, nor proposes concordats
with Pontius Pilate, nor offers easy careers to the ambitious, but rather
leads to prison....</p>
</div>

<p>Silone’s hero is equally dissatisfied with a religious vocation which withdraws
from life. He talks with the beautiful and spiritual Christina, who
devoutly waits to enter the convent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do you not think that this divorce between a spirituality which retires into contemplation
and a mass of people dominated by animal instincts is the source of
all our ills? Do you not think that every living creature ought to live and struggle
among his fellow-creatures rather than shut himself up in an ivory tower?</p>
</div>

<p>Although <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em> contains more scenes set in Rome
than the other two Silone novels discussed here, a better view of the Italian
city dweller is given by Taddei and Moravia. Taddei’s <em>The Pine Tree and
the Mole</em> is built about citizens of Livorno who are as widely separated by
wealth and position as are Silone’s Old Zaccaria and the Tarocchi family.
The circle of lawyers and politicians who exchange wives and party labels
are a different breed of men from the jailbirds, pimps, and informers at the
opposite extreme of Livorno’s social structure. But both groups are equally
adrift, both caught in the same wave of post-World War I exhaustion and
economic derangement which sent so many Italians in search of the answer
that Mussolini seemed to provide. Taddei emphasizes poverty and
depression as the main factors which prepared the way for the Fascist
regime, but one senses something else, particularly among his representatives
of the educated class. They seem to be seeking some sort of order, a
stabilizing force in their political life. Taddei says that the Italian Socialist
Party seemed to offer the solution. But the Socialists failed because</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>overwhelmed by the favorable-seeming course of events and overlooking the
most important phase of the matter, they lacked the time to think of many
things and, instead, viewed the period with optimistic eyes; everything appeared
to them to depend upon the number of adherents that any particular event
brought into their ranks. Political expediency thus became, in a manner of speaking,
epidemic, and the deepening crisis in all its amplitude became apparent in
the form of a spiritual crisis that was its reflection.</p>
</div>

<p>Marcello Clerici in <em>The Conformist</em> finds his solution in Fascism.
Taddei’s hero turns at last to the same source of strength which Silone
singles out&mdash;the land and its people. They both feel, rather like Orwell,
that the masses are the ultimate source of their country’s salvation. Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Lazzaro, shouting defiance at the Communists, epitomizes these people:
“There’ll always be someone that refuses to sell his soul for a handful of
beans and a piece of cheese.” In this he is like Conrad’s Giorgio Viola,
“the Garibaldino,” an old expatriate whose divinities are Garibaldi and
Liberty.</p>

<p>This small group of Italian novelists portray their countrymen as members
of widely separated economic and social classes. There are the well-to-do
who seem to seek order and get it with a vengeance. And there are
the poor of the cities and villages who are the victims of this order,
squeezed by poverty, by powerful landowners, and harnessed by a church
which renders more than is his to Caesar, a church which brings politics
into the confessional and divorces religion from everyday life. Something
of the spirit of Garibaldi still lives, however, nourished by the deprived
ones who are close to the soil. Perhaps this is a modern political parable in
which the last shall be first.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">SPAIN: AN AMERICAN PORTRAIT</p>

<p>Robert Jordan’s love of Spain is not an abstract emotion. He has a deep
feeling for its people, but he is still able to see their faults. Throughout
<em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em> he makes conscious estimates of their national
character. He says they are a truly thoughtful and considerate people who
are not merely formally polite as are the French. But they are also treacherous:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of course they turned on you. They turned on you often but they always turned
on everyone. They turned on themselves, too. If you had three together, two
would unite against one, and then the two would start to betray each other.
Not always, but often enough for you to take enough cases and start to draw it
as a conclusion.</p>
</div>

<p>These characteristics cut across party lines. The Rebel slaughter which left
Jordan’s Maria orphaned and violated had an equally brutal counterpart in
the Republican massacre supervised by the guerrilla chief Pablo in which
twenty Fascists were beaten between two lines of men and then flung over
a cliff. Jordan thinks that killing “is their extra sacrament.” Loving them,
he tries to understand them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no finer and no worse people in the world. No kinder people and no
crueler.... Forgiveness is a Christian idea and Spain has never been a Christian
country. It has always had its own special idol worship within the Church....
The people had grown away from the Church because the Church was in the
government and the government had always been rotten. This was the only
country that the reformation never reached. They were paying for the Inquisition
now, all right.</p>
</div>

<p>Occasionally one finds a Spaniard who seems almost a moderate, like
Frankie Perez in <em>Adventures of a Young Man</em>, but the most persistent impression
is one of a people who have a history of misrule and violence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
who tragically turn to these very weapons as the instruments of release
from their consequences.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">GREECE: AN AMERICAN PORTRAIT</p>

<p>George Weller’s Greeks in <em>The Crack in the Column</em> appear surprisingly
like Latins: “Each Greek is a volcano, and when he may erupt no man
knows, not even his friends who must quake with him, not even himself.”
In the number and complexity of their political parties they resemble the
French, yet in one way they seem to retain something of the Greeks of
antiquity viewing Imperial Rome. Small and impoverished in the shadow
of newly-risen giants, they cherish their role as inheritors and transmitters
of a great culture. At the book’s end, Nitsa, like Molly Bloom in Joyce’s
Ulysses, retires with her reflections:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The whole world is philhellene, as proved by the retreating Germans leaving
a wreath on the Tomb of Ignotos before they roared north to die in the ambushes
of the Slavs. But most self-surrendering of the philhellenes are the Americans.
These young antiques deserve the most utter respect, the kindest care.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2 center big1">FRANCE: A COMPOSITE PORTRAIT</p>

<p>The novels by Frenchmen in this study reveal relatively little about national
character and behavior. Stendhal deals with Italians and Malraux
primarily with Chinese. However, the ambitious Ferral, head of the Franco-Asiatic
Consortium in <em>Man’s Fate</em> may be revealing. He hopes to make
enough money in China to return home and buy the leading French news-gathering
and publicity syndicate. With this power he hopes to regain
office and “pit the combined forces of the cabinet and a bought public
opinion against the Parliament.” In Malraux’s words one catches, under
their cynicism, echoes of the declining power reflecting upon vanished
days of affluence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The threat of bankruptcy brings to financial groups an intense national consciousness.
When their enterprises in distant corners of the world are suddenly
threatened with disaster they remember with mingled pride and gratitude the
heritage of civilization which their country has given them and which they in
turn have helped to pass on to colonial peoples.</p>
</div>

<p>In <em>Presidential Agent</em> Sinclair presents the French as a people who have
installed a rotten government to manage their affairs, a government eager
to join with Britain in obtaining temporary surcease from German threats
to its financial holdings by hypocritically sacrificing Czechoslovakia. They
had decided upon “a compromise with Hitler as the cheapest form of insurance.”
M. Denis admits the resultant loss of power in Central Europe,
but consoles himself with the thought that “we still have North Africa
and the colonies, and we are safe behind our Maginot Line. Above all, we
don’t have to make any more concessions to revolution at home.”</p>

<p>In <em>The Age of Longing</em> Hydie Anderson reports Feyda Nikitin’s deadly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
activities to Jules Commanche of the French Home Security Department.
A scholar and hero of the Resistance, he is one of a new type, but there are
not enough of them to fill “the sclerotic veins of French bureaucracy with
fresh blood.” Their effect amounts merely to “the injection of a stimulant
into a moribund body.” In <em>The Reprieve</em> Sartre had presented France as
unaware and unready before the Nazis, already bled white from great wars.
After another conflict, the patient is almost in extremis. Playing the recurrent
part of American pupil to European teacher, Hydie listens to Commanche’s
bitter lecture:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our last message to the world was those three words which are on our stamps
and coins. Since then, we no longer have anything to give to the spirit, only
to the senses&mdash;our novelists, our poets, our painters, all belong to an essentially
sensualist world, the world of Flaubert, and Baudelaire and Manet, not to the
world of Descartes, Rousseau and St. Just. For several centuries we were the
inspiration of Europe; now we are in the position of a blood donor dying of
anemia. We can’t hope for a new Jeanne d’Arc, not even for a young First
Consul, not even for a Charlotte Corday....</p>
</div>

<p>He has told Hydie that the French Revolution substituted its slogan for
the Holy Trinity, that the scalpel which excised autocracy from the body
politic also removed its soul. The French thus seem to be suffering from a
malady which, in somewhat different form, infects the Spaniards, Italians,
and Greeks. Their splinter parties, their disorganization, their pervasive
political cynicism are a legacy of centuries of conflict, inequities, and
colonial misrule. But beyond this there is exhaustion, a vitality sapped by
past efforts and a sadness increased by awareness of faded glories.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">RUSSIA: A COMPOSITE PORTRAIT</p>

<p>Assessing Russian national character or behavior from the novels presents
a greater problem than that found in any other national literature.
One must first separate Russian Communism from the Russian people.
In the same way one must distinguish the old Russian from the new. And
this dichotomy has to be made after the Revolution as well as before it.
Turgenev’s fathers are hardly more different from their sons than are
Koestler’s Old Guard from the Neanderthalers they have sired. When
Rubashov’s old comrade Ivanov is shot, Gletkin replaces him as interrogator.
Rubashov looks at the shaven skull, appraising the huge ominous figure
in the stiff heavy uniform: “You consequential brute in the uniform
we created&mdash;barbarian of the new age which is now starting.”</p>

<p>The pattern of Russian political behavior which emerges from the novel
is filled with more violence, more misery, more oppression than that of any
other national group. The dying Stepan Verhovensky described Russia in
<em>The Possessed</em> as a “great invalid” inhabited by devils and plagued with
impurities, sores, and foul contagions. This Czarist Russia is a land in which
“harmless ... higher liberalism” is possible, but it is also a country in
which serfs live in incredible poverty and aristocrats live in oriental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
splendor. Within this social structure, whose opposite ends are separated
by an even greater distance than the rich and poor of Italy, the forces of
destruction are already at work. The basic situation reveals opposed characteristics:
authoritarianism on the ruling level, immense capacity for dumb
suffering in the submerged masses, and an intense drive toward a reorientation
of the social structure on the part of the militant intellectuals. These
factors, on a smaller scale, are to be found in other literatures. But Dostoyevsky
also portrays a conflict peculiar to Russia. It is the struggle between
those culturally oriented toward the West and the Slavophiles who reject
its influence. A Slavophile himself, Dostoyevsky seems to speak through
Shatov, who says that the Russians are “the only ‘god-bearing’ people on
earth, destined to regenerate and save the world in the name of a new God,
and to whom are given the keys of life and of the new world....” This
extreme national consciousness pervades these novels, whether it is expressed
in terms of a messianic mission or a deep sympathy for a people with
a tragic history.</p>

<p>Conrad, in <em>Under Western Eyes</em>, made a definite effort to assess the
Russian character. He felt, though, that this was an extremely difficult task
in which the language barrier was the least of the obstacles which stood in
the way of understanding. He describes Russians as great players with
words, manipulators of abstract ideas. He feels that in other areas their behavior,
like that of Nathalia Haldin, is sometimes almost incomprehensible.
His narrator says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I knew her well enough to have discovered her scorn for all the practical forms
of political liberty known to the Western world. I suppose one must be a Russian
to understand Russian simplicity, a terrible, corroding simplicity in which
mystic phrases clothe a naïve and hopeless cynicism. I think sometimes that the
psychological secret of the profound difference of that people consists in this
that they detest life, the irremediable life of the earth as it is, whereas we
Westerners cherish it with perhaps an equal exaggeration of its sentimental value.</p>
</div>

<p>Nathalia tells the old teacher that “the shadow of autocracy” hangs over
each Russian, much as does its more substantial modern counterpart, the
Soviet MVD. Razumov is another Slavophile who believes that Russia is
sacred. But later Conrad returns to the subject of Russian incomprehensibility
when he says that Western ears “are not attuned to certain tones
of cynicism and cruelty of moral negation, and even of moral distress already
silenced at our end of Europe.”</p>

<p>Koestler’s two novels considered here describe Russia after the deluge.
The bloodbaths have changed the names and faces, but the same moral
negation is there. More accurately, there is not even a negation, for there
is no positive assertion of moral values to negate. The doctrine that history
has no conscience had removed for the Soviets the need for moral reference
points. As a result, they had sailed without the ethical ballast that
Rubashov, at the end of his life, decided was essential. In his judgment this
was the fatal break in the logical chain which caused the betrayal of the
revolution which Mailer mourned in <em>Barbary Shore</em>. In this case, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
history is character. The span of events covered by these novels might even
be graphed. The line would form itself into two low plateaus separated by
a single tremendous peak. This eminence would represent the ill-fated revolt
against tyranny. On either side would be the depths in which a people
was submerged with not quite passive suffering under a rigid, repressive
rule made possible by a long historical pattern and the mass conditioning
to obedience which it produced.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA: A SELF-PORTRAIT</p>

<p>The Boers of South Africa are presented, especially in Paton’s novels, as
a simple and stern people who are also good fighters and good haters. Subduing
part of a continent and making it their own, they regard themselves
as the elect among the children of men quite as much as do the Slavophiles.
Yet these Afrikaners suffer from a curious case of schizophrenia.
Singled out by the Almighty, they are nonetheless so fearful of the colored
population that they repress them as harshly as any European nation ever
did its colonial peoples. Early in <em>Too Late the Phalarope</em> Paton epitomizes
this national group:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>they had trekked from the British Government with its officials and its missionaries
and its laws that made a black man as good as his master, and had
trekked into a continent, dangerous and trackless, where wild beasts and savage
men, and grim waterless plains, had given way before their fierce will to be
separate and survive. Then out of the harsh world of rock and stone they had
come to the grass country, all green and smiling, and had given to it the names
of peace and thankfulness. They had built their homes and their churches; and
as God had chosen them for a people, so did they choose him for their God,
cherishing their separateness that was now his Will. They set their conquered
enemies apart, ruling them with unsmiling justice, declaring “no equality in
Church or State,” and making the iron law that no white man might touch a
black woman, nor might any white woman be touched by a black man.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a patriarchal society, ruled by men such as Jakob Van Vlaanderen,
a political leader who privately calls the members of Parliament “his span
of oxen.” Fiercely nationalistic, they hate the British, and as they fought
them so they fight any force, even a sociological one, which threatens their
hard-won supremacy. In the Union of South Africa there are willing British
subjects and British sympathizers, but they have not been represented by
a group of novels as fine as these of Paton’s. This is perhaps due to the fact
that they do not form so homogeneous a cultural and ethnic group as do
the Boers and their descendants. For another thing, the political star of
the Boers has been in the ascendant in the past few decades, while that of
the pro-British has seemed about to set as it did in India.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">GERMANY: A SELF-PORTRAIT</p>

<p>When Sinclair’s Lanny Budd goes to the week-long Nazi Party orgy at
Nüremberg, he sees before him a people who have surrendered personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
responsibility to a father image quite as fully as did Silone’s simple peasants.
A people smarting from humiliating defeat had accepted the dream of a
thousand year Reich. And it had been sold to them by a man as possessed
as any of Dostoyevsky’s characters. Roderich Stamm in <em>Heaven Pays No
Dividends</em> is oblivious to much of the transition that takes place in Germany
during the late twenties and early thirties. Through his father’s conversations,
however, he senses some of the problems soon to be expressed
in political action: “They contained the whole uncertainty of our age.
There was something intangible and threatening in the air. It had all
started with the world crisis and the huge unemployment figures, and then
the Nazis had come, and then the Communists.” These forces and the
movements which they precipitate are too strong for a republic barely fifteen
years old. A people used to authoritarian rule reverts to it. When war
comes Roderich realizes “we were all involved, because all of us had
capitulated before HIM during all these years. We had all given HIM permission
to start a war at HIS discretion, when HE decided it was necessary.”
One is justified in distrusting stereotypes as inaccurate generalizations.
But in this case the stereotype is borne out and emphasized in the
novel.</p>

<p>Many areas of these national portraits are only roughed in, with the fine-line
detail missing. In other places there are gaps. This is partly because
some of the groups of novels are small. It is also due to the fact that the
novelist does not exhaustively examine voting trends, statistically analyze
attitudinal changes, or plot the frequency of government realignments. Sinclair
frequently approaches this method and Dos Passos gives some of the
raw data upon which such estimates can be made. But generally the novelist
tends to proceed from individuals to groups, extrapolating group behavior
from individual behavior. This is the method used by Koestler and Conrad.
While it does not have the statistical validity of the political scientist’s
work, it has advantages which complement it. The novelist, with his
artistic insight and his ability to shape his material as he wishes, can highlight
his concept of a particular national character with drama and human
interest to make this hard-to-define quality come memorably alive on the
printed page.</p>

The Novelist as Analyst of Group Political Behavior</h2>
</div>




<p>The economic criterion is one of two means used by the political novel
for classifying groups. The other index identifies groups by means of overt
political behavior&mdash;party membership, acceptance of discipline, performance
of specific acts. These two means of classification are not parallel but
complementary. The first, in a sense, serves as a background for the second.
Although the first is economic, its validity lies in the fact that party lines
tend to follow economic ones, that modern political theory, particularly
that of revolution, has been based increasingly upon economic facts as well
as political ones. The approach of this chapter differs from that of the
previous one in tracing behavior patterns which cut across national lines.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">ECONOMIC GROUPS</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Lumpenproletariat</b></p>

<p>In trying to use these indices of group behavior it is no longer possible
to deal in general terms such as “the poor.” Though “proletariat” may be
precise enough for Marxism, even this term is too inclusive for close
analysis of the material in these novels. Several gradations are possible
within this least fortunate group on the economic scale. Professor Ambrogio
Donini’s introduction to the Italian edition of <em>The Pine Tree and the
Mole</em> identifies the lowest group in that novel as members of the <em>lumpenproletariat</em>.
These people are not the workers whose taking of the factories
Taddei fleetingly mentions. They are the lowest stratum of Livorno’s life,
the drifters and criminals from whom the Fascists recruited members for
their Black Shirt squads. It is their motivation as much as their behavior
which differentiates them from the workers. While groups of militant
workers are usually presented as trying to better the lot of their whole
group, these members of the <em>lumpenproletariat</em> seem to be entrepreneurs.
Rubachiuchi becomes an agent provocateur for the Fascists not to help the
poverty-stricken, but simply to help himself. After he infiltrates an anarchist
group, he aids in its destruction, not because he is personally opposed to
anarchism, but because this is the job his employers are paying him to do.
Very often in these novels one encounters Communists trying to destroy
Socialists ostensibly because Socialism is thought to be a palliative rather
than a solution to the worker’s problems. But these underworld figures do
not have even this theoretical justification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Although this group is not nearly so numerous in the novel as many
others, its representatives occasionally appear. In <em>Fontamara</em>, Peppino
Goriano returns to Fontamara after thirty-five years, some of them spent in
a “political career” in Rome. A good man, he had been forced by starvation
to become an agent <em>provocateur</em> for the police. He had earned five lire a
day plus a twenty-five lire bonus each time a job resulted in his going to
the hospital. For a brief time he had been a hero after a picture of him
helping to wreck a Communist newspaper office had appeared in a newspaper.
But the “Hero of Porta Pia” lost the honest job he had finally found
when it was decided that “fascism could no longer shelter in its bosom such
delinquents as had been convicted several times for theft.” Pablo in <em>For
Whom the Bell Tolls</em> is a study in deterioration. A cruel but effective anti-Fascist
at the beginning of the war, he is found by Robert Jordan to be a
sotted semi-bandit who opposes Jordan’s blowing of the bridge. Having
lost control of the band to his woman Pilar, Pablo tries unsuccessfully to
forestall the demolition by stealing part of Jordan’s equipment. Although
he leads the retreat after the bridge is blown, Pablo is no longer one of
the “illusioned ones.” He is a guerrilla who retains only his violence and
a dominating desire for survival. Old Zaccaria in <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em>
is a bandit first and a partisan second. He had received a decoration for a
crippling encounter with a German patrol, but the source of the battle
was a truckload of cheese which he intended for the black market rather
than a desire to free Italy. These characters are not nearly such low forms
of life as some of the members of Taddei’s <em>lumpenproletariat</em>, but they are
a part of that group to be found on the fringes of most political conflicts,
individuals motivated by desire for personal gain rather than by principle.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Peasants</b></p>

<p>Almost as submerged in the economic structure is the peasant class.
Here too there are extra-national similarities. The <em>paisans</em> of Silone and
Taddei and the <em>muzhiks</em> of Turgenev and Dostoyevsky have characteristics
in common. Ground down by oppression and exploitation, they engage in
political action only as a result of outside stimulation rather than as a result
of spontaneous desire among themselves. Often they may be too devitalized
even to do that. When Bazarov in <em>Fathers and Sons</em> tells the peasants that
they are the hope of Russia, he does not suspect “that in their eyes he was
all the while something of the nature of a buffooning clown.” In a more
subtle way Don Paolo tries to awaken the peasants of Pietrasecca in <em>Bread
and Wine</em>. He has a little success with parables, but a direct attack upon
issues produces nothing. When he goes to Fossa he asks the lawyer Zabaglione
about peasant participation in the now disbanded Socialist Leagues.
Zabaglione tells him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What Socialism meant to most of them was a chance to work and eat till their
stomachs were full, to work and sleep in peace, without having to be afraid of
the morrow. In the league premises at Fossa, next to the bearded portrait of
Karl Marx, there was a picture of Christ in a red shirt. On Saturday nights the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
peasants came to the league to sing “Up, brothers! Brothers, arise!” and on
Sunday morning they went to Mass to say “Amen.” The permanent occupation
of a Socialist leader was writing recommendations.</p>
</div>

<p>The American representatives of this class seem much the same. Garland’s
<em>A Spoil of Office</em> follows the abortive political careers of the Grange
and the Farmer’s Alliance. Bradley Talcott sees this latter movement as
“the most pathetic, tragic, and desperate revolt against oppression and
wrong ever made by the American farmer.” His guiding star Ida puts it even
more simply: “While our great politicians split hairs on the tariff, people
starve. The time has come for rebellion.” Conditions in Iowa have changed
eighty years later, but in the deep South they are almost as bad. William
Russell’s <em>A Wind Is Rising</em> (1950) focuses on Negro tenant farmers charged
500 per cent interest by the landowners and cheated of part of the cotton
crop they succeed in raising.</p>

<p>Whether he is Prince Torlonia or a Russian noble, the large landholder
is most often seen in the novel as the embodiment of the forces which
keep the peasant class in subjection. Men like Nikolai Kirsanov in <em>Fathers
and Sons</em> may attempt to improve conditions, but the predominant pattern
is one of exploitation which eventually produces violence. At the end
of <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em> the peasants kill a bailiff when they invade the
Tarocchi pasture lands they believe to be rightfully theirs. Debased and deprived,
lacking political awareness, and incited by members of other classes,
the peasant group turns to violence. In some areas of the world, particularly
the United States and England, a steady economic evolution has
tended to eliminate large segments of this group. The Russian peasant appears
still to be a peasant, even though he may be a Stakhanovite worker
in a large <em>kolkhoz</em>. But where the class still exists in a society in which
violent protest is still possible, the pattern appears unchanged.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Labor</b></p>

<p>Commenting on one of the causes of the failure of the farmers’ movements
of the seventies, Garland said: “They had made the mistake of
supposing that the interests of merchant, artisan, and mechanic were also
inimical.” In the novel these interests are not at all inimical. They are rather
parallel, for the labor movement (which includes the last two groups mentioned
by Garland) has as its natural antagonist the moneyed class to
which the peasants’ adversaries belong. And in the novel the laborer is
treated as sympathetically as the peasant, with the single exception of
Disraeli’s <em>Sybil</em>, which gives an antagonistic picture of the trade unions.
But there are two significant differences between the peasant class and the
industrial labor class. The latter has adopted different methods and has
met with a large degree of success.</p>

<p>The political behavior and history of the labor movement emerges very
clearly in the novel. This group fought its first violent battles to achieve
organization. When this was accomplished, concerted action in which the
strike was the principal weapon was begun to attain better working standards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
In societies in which unions are still free, the strike has retained its
tactical importance, but it has been accompanied by progressively less
violence. And as strife has decreased, a more effective technique has taken
its place. The labor movement has gone into politics. The most overt form
of this policy is the formation of a labor party like the one so successful
in England. Less direct but still effective is the method used by American
unions of supporting the party which seems most likely to serve labor’s
interests. Peasants’ leagues and farmers’ groups had been formed to take
direct political action, but none achieved such spectacular success as these
labor groups. Unlike the peasants, the laborers had to a large extent provided
their own leadership. Indicative of their more cohesive and militant
nature is the frequently expressed distrust of people in the movement coming
from non-labor classes. In <em>Marcella</em> the radical Nemiah Wilkins is suspicious
of Socialist Harry Wharton. He feels that he is too well dressed and
educated to lead a labor movement, and he looks forward to the day when
they “would be able to show these young aristocrats the door.” Penelope
Muff, a dedicated organizer in <em>Fame Is the Spur</em>, has the same feeling
toward two women who work actively in the Socialist cause. They give both
time and money, but to Pen they are outsiders taking a dilettante interest
in the poor.</p>

<p>That labor’s energies would be channeled into politics rather than violence
seemed at one time impossible. Looking back at his youth, Tom
Wilcher recalls in <em>To Be a Pilgrim</em> that then “the rich men were still
boundless in wealth and arrogance; the poor were in misery, and neither
saw any possibility of change without the overthrow of society.” But the
labor movement made the transition from a mob to a party. Pen Muff and
Hamer Shawcross had seen it achieved when Keir Hardie, wearing a cloth
cap rather than a top hat, drove down London’s streets in a wagonette
instead of a brougham to take his seat in the House of Commons. And
labor remained so conscious of its class origins that Shawcross seemed
guilty almost of blasphemy years later when, as a Labourite minister, he
wore his ceremonial uniform with its sword and cocked hat. Figures in the
novel recall the lines from Browning’s <em>The Lost Leader</em> about the man
who had betrayed his group “just for a riband to stick in his coat.” Such a
one is Hamer Shawcross. Another is Chester Nimmo. Their supposed betrayal
seems more heinous because of this class consciousness. Dick Remington
may change from Liberal to Tory with a minimum of obloquy, but
when Shawcross enters a wartime coalition government he is a Judas.</p>

<p>When Sinclair published <em>Oil!</em> in 1926 he saw the activities of the labor
movement almost completely in terms of a class struggle. But it was an
index of the relative progress of the American movement as compared with
the English that strike violence remained the chief weapon on this side of
the Atlantic. Two years later, in <em>Boston</em>, the situation was worse. He wrote
that Massachusetts had “evolved a complete technique of labor smashing”
in which a strike-breaking department developed in the Boston police
force was rented out to manufacturers in neighboring towns. He concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
that Sacco and Vanzetti were not convicted and executed for a fatal armed
robbery. They were killed because they represented the forces of social revolt
to the banking and industrial interests which felt themselves critically
threatened. Even eight years later, <em>In Dubious Battle</em> represented large
segments of the labor group as ill-treated men whose efforts to attain better
wages and working conditions were opposed, not only by the employers,
but by the forces of the state as well. It is in Dos Passos’ books that the
American labor movement is seen making the transition from economic to
political action. In <em>Adventures of a Young Man</em> the pecan-shellers, the
miners, the auto-workers are organized as forces which will obtain concessions
through direct economic action rather than legislation. But <em>The
Grand Design</em> shows labor at work within the Democratic Party. There is
no nationwide labor party, but the votes of the labor group are marshalled
in support of candidates whose programs will provide them with legislative
relief.</p>

<p>The continental labor movements, particularly the Italian, are portrayed
in the novel as having a greater history of violence and misfortune than
those in either England or the United States. Taddei’s Socialist workers
take over their factories at gun point. Silone’s laborers are victimized by
The Promoter. Koestler’s Rubashov recalls his mission of telling Little
Loewy that the interests of his Belgian dock workers were to be subordinated
to those of Russia. Similarly, the Fascists had destroyed the Italian
labor movement for the purposes of the corporate state. And, of course, the
classic irony was the full name for which “Nazi” stood: National Socialist
German Workers Party.</p>

<p>The behavior patterns of the labor movement traced in the novel reveal
gradual change. A more homogeneous and dynamic group than the peasants,
labor has just as extensive a heritage of exploitation and strife. Although
leadership has sometimes come from outside their class, it has been
provided to a large extent by a dedicated and indigenous elite. Whole
national labor movements have been submerged under totalitarianism;
others have appeared to be sacrificed as pawns by leaders intent upon personal
aggrandizement. But as the movement has matured, old weapons
have been used with increasing moderation and new ones have been added
to the arsenal. Organs such as the CIO Political Action Committee appear
in none of the novels in this study, but such instruments typify the new
tactics by which gains are obtained through political pressure. The archetype,
of course, is England’s Labour Party, which, in assuming national
power, has had to make the final transition by directing legislation which
should benefit not only its own members but those of all classes of the
nation. This represents an evolutionary development which is a reflection
of some of the English national characteristics seen in the novel. Perhaps
one ends not with a conclusion but with a question. The conservatives
and liberals, the Republicans and Democrats, derive their strength from
areas which are fairly well defined but which to some extent cut across
economic and occupational lines. Can an instrument forged in hottest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
partisan conflict discharge the responsibility which comes with the attainment
of the goal of political power? Can it legislate for a society, or will
its antecedents compel it to serve a special interest group?</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Proletarians</b></p>

<p>During the thirties members of the peasant and labor groups were the
subject of a literary movement which produced the proletarian novel. This
type of novel is generally unsatisfactory for the study of group behavior patterns
considered here since its emphasis is much more sociological than
political. There are some exceptions, however. <em>The Iron Heel</em>, <em>Man’s Fate</em>,
and <em>In Dubious Battle</em> have been called proletarian novels. Other proletarian
novels not included in this study were written by Dos Passos, Farrell,
Shaw, and Silone. The two novels by Malraux and Steinbeck straddle the
line between the political and the proletarian. This is also true of <em>A Wind Is
Rising</em>, which came after the movement as such had spent itself but which
concentrated upon one of its favorite subjects, the southern sharecropper.
Some of the proletarian novels have political overtones. Sherwood Anderson’s
<em>Beyond Desire</em> (1932), which was meant as his contribution to the
proletarian cause, followed the career of Red Oliver as a Communist labor
organizer in southern textile mills. Like Jim Nolan, he is shot to death. But
this novel does not reveal as fully as Steinbeck’s book the part of the Communist
Party’s labor strategy in its overall plan. The men of Liam
O’Flaherty’s <em>The Informer</em> are proletarians, members of the Irish Republican
Army fighting the British. But in its most common form, the
proletarian novel stopped just short of political action. It would present in
dramatic fashion the conditions under which the members of this actually
diverse group lived. If they took positive action, it was usually to join a
union or the Communist Party. Steinbeck’s <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> shows
the broad scale social delineation the proletarian novel permits; it also
shows clearly that though its ultimate aim may be political, its primary
textual emphasis is not.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Middle Class</b></p>

<p>The middle class is not as well represented as other groups in the political
novel. Of course, definition is a problem. In terms of economics, Glenn
Spotswood and Robert Jordan are members of the middle class. In terms
of politics, however, they are not bourgeois but intellectuals, Jordan a
liberal and Spotswood a radical. Perhaps the true middle class does not
provide enough drama for the novelist who deals with politics. Most of the
people in <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em> are middle class citizens, but they do not
move and act in their normal environment. Their apathy has permitted the
rise of a dictatorship, forcing them into the role of the persecuted or the
underground fighter. Most often a novelist using a middle class hero will
work a transformation upon him in which he changes his class identity. He
will, like Glenn Spotswood, cast his lot with the class economically below
his. Or, like Harvey Sayler in <em>The Plum Tree</em>, he will rise above it through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
political advancement which brings him power and wealth. In rare cases,
the hero will manage to ride both horses at once. Peter Stirling, in Ford’s
novel, will obviously be a successful candidate for the governorship of New
York. But his stepping stone has been nearly twenty years of work in New
York City’s tenement-ridden Sixth Ward. Ford’s style virtually guarantees
that Stirling will be neither fish, flesh, nor fowl by the end of the book,
but his career too makes it impossible to label him a member of the middle
class from which he started. In <em>The Grand Design</em> Dos Passos sometimes
shows the middle class Washington office worker. Throughout <em>District of
Columbia</em>, particularly in his prose poems, he refers to or quotes members
of this class along with the executives and laborers. But there is such
diversity that it is difficult to draw conclusions. Perhaps this difficulty in
discerning pronounced patterns is in itself an indication of the nature of
this class. Midway between the economic and political extremes, it has a
leavening of the characteristics of both. But the political figure who comes
from the middle class most often leaves it. If he does not, he apparently
has less interest for the political novelist.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Rich and Well Born</b></p>

<p>The economic and social upper classes appear in more different hues
than any other class. They vary all the way from “red” millionaires like
<em>Oil!</em>'s Bunny Ross to the same novel’s many “malefactors of great wealth.”
Except for Disraeli’s heroes, his aristocrats are very often those usually described
as “the product of exhausted loins.” Unless members of the English
aristocracy take an active interest in the welfare of the classes below their
own, they are usually portrayed as despising them. George Meredith’s
aristocrat appears to hate these occupants of a world different from his.
The Debarry family in <em>Felix Holt</em> has humanitarian impulses, but its political
action is directed toward maintaining its elevated position. Trollope’s
aristocratic Liberals make efforts toward legislation which will reduce inequities,
but far more typical is the old Earl, “Buck” Lostwithiel in <em>Fame
Is the Spur</em>. A wringer of the poor and accident-maker for inconvenient
opponents, he is deterred from horsewhipping Hamer Shawcross only by a
raised sabre.</p>

<p>The evil aristocrat is not so common in the American novel as in the
English. Mrs. Stowe and Tourgée portray him during the latter half of
the nineteenth century in the South. Sinclair’s Back Bay Brahmins, years
later, take violent action, sticking neither at hypocrisy nor dishonesty, to
assert a form of slavery which is more economic than legislative. But aside
from villains such as those in <em>The Plum Tree</em>, whose power actually comes
more from money than lineage, the villainous role is usually assigned to
the industrialist rather than the blueblood. This may be a substantiation of
the charge that the primary aristocracy of America is one of wealth rather
than breeding or cultivation. The Italian noble class is consistently portrayed
as an oppressor no matter what the form of government under which
it operates. Serfs are freed and reforms are instituted in <em>Fathers and Sons</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
but offstage are the sounds of floggings and the murmurs of oppressed
victims. The Marchesa Raversi’s Liberal Party in <em>The Charterhouse of
Parma</em> is anything but liberal. Individuals like the radical poet Ferrante
Palla find as little favor with her as they do with the absolutist Ernesto IV.
Separated from these nobles by time and space, Malraux’s Ferral and his
backers have as little sympathy for the Chinese on whom they thrive as does
Fabio Conti for Parma’s commoners.</p>

<p>There are some good aristocrats in the political novel. All of Disraeli’s
Young England heroes approach politics with high seriousness and dedication.
Coningsby is so suffused with virtue that he keeps his purity unsullied
at the expense of losing his inheritance. Tancred’s politics are intermingled
with a religious mysticism that leads him to the Holy Land. Meredith’s
Beauchamp is such an emotional firebrand in his radical convictions that he
makes Disraeli’s young men look like mild and high minded Rover Boys.
But he belongs to their class. A little farther down on the social and economic
scale is Cary’s Edward Wilcher. A politician of entirely different
kidney from these zealous young men, he is a sophisticated and cynical
careerist who writes embarrassing epigrams about members of his own
party. But he is like the others in his concern for progressive legislation
rather than perpetuation of the privileges of his own social group. Augustine
St. Clare is one of Mrs. Stowe’s better slave-owners. He is obviously on his
way to salvation, partly through the influence of saintly Uncle Tom, when
he is untimely carved by a bowie-knife wielded in a fight he has attempted
to stop. It is this accident which prevents him from freeing Tom. Churchill’s
Humphrey Crewe is an eccentric and fatuous ass, but his intentions are
pure gold. He seeks office because he believes he can benefit the state. In
<em>The Grand Design</em>, Jed Farrington refers to “the Squire in the White
House and his big business friends.” But it is clear in the book that though
Big Business may conceivably have derived some benefits from the Roosevelt
administrations, this descendant of New York state patroons was
politically oriented toward less pedigreed groups. If one were to compile a
balance sheet for this class, however, the villains would far outnumber the
heroes.</p>

<p>Good men of wealth are even harder to find in this group of novels than
good aristocrats. Disraeli’s magnates are the type who in modern America
receive awards from chambers of commerce and engraved gold watches
from deputations of employees. Elsewhere, the industrialist is a top-hatted
advocate of <em>laissez-faire</em> economics whose wealth is acquired more through
the sweat of his underprivileged workers than by his own acumen. Millbank
in <em>Coningsby</em> and Trafford in <em>Sybil</em> are rising merchant princes who are
considerate of their workers and industrially progressive. But either they are
ahead of their time or the industrialists who follow them in the novel are
throwbacks to a more primitive industrial era. In <em>The New Machiavelli</em>
Dick Remington’s uncle is presented as a reactionary beast. His Newcastle
pottery factory produces death as well as cups and saucers. He is as unwilling
to install fans that will carry off the deadly fumes from the lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
glaze as he is to concede any rights at all to his workers. The Rhondda
Valley, where Pen Muff goes as the bride of union official Arnold Ryerson,
has more than its share of Welsh women widowed by the coal mines. The
management group remains in the background of this novel, but the
miners’ efforts to obtain concessions which would now seem minimal are
evidence of an attitude not dissimilar to that of Dick Remington’s uncle.
In Conrad’s <em>Nostromo</em> Charles Gould has justified his decisive intervention
in Costaguanan politics by declaring that he was providing order which
would benefit the natives as well as himself. Gould’s political commitment
gives rise to one of the central problems of the novel&mdash;the extent to which
his soul has been eroded to insure the undisturbed flow of the bright silver
ingots from the San Tomas mine. Gould is not the only victim of his
obsession. The other is his wife, who is all but shut out of vital areas of his
life and thought. Early in the book he gives her his rationale:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I pin my faith to material interests. Only let the material interests once get
a firm footing, and they are bound to impose the conditions on which alone
they can continue to exist. That’s how your money-making is justified here in
the face of lawlessness and disorder. It is justified because the security which
it demands must be shared with an oppressed people. A better justice will come
afterwards. That’s your ray of hope.</p>
</div>

<p>All of the lobbying groups in the American novels are financed by industrial
wealth. Whether the checks are signed by railroaders, utilities operators,
or oil men, their purpose is the same: to apply pressure which will
gain concessions. And, of course, in many cases these concessions cause a
direct or indirect loss to citizens in lower income brackets. In <em>The Plum
Tree</em> Harvey Sayler uses his power to make an example of one of these men,
“the greediest and cruelest ‘robber baron’ in the West.” The lords of Jack
London’s Oligarchy specialize in the repression of workers with frequent
resort to calculated mass murder. The climate had changed by the time Dos
Passos wrote <em>The Grand Design</em>, but he included the lineal descendant of
these predators. Jerry Evans retains a substantial interest in his economic
welfare even as coordinator of Roosevelt’s War Procurement Board.
Columnist Ed James’s off-the-record analysis is that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All Jerry can think of in the emergency is to use it to turn things back into the
business as usual channels an’ we all know that in the southeast at least business
as usual means Jerry Evans’ business. Of course he has cleared his skirts technically
by resignin’ from the directorates of most of his corporations.... But
they are still his corporations.</p>
</div>

<p>Individuals of wealth in the novel may derive their money from farming
rather than industry, but unenlightened self-interest is still the chief
motivating factor. This is the case with the powerful ones in <em>A Wind Is
Rising</em>. Mulcting their sharecroppers, they derive added revenue from convenient
prohibition laws. Other Dos Passos characters like Jerry Evans
retain their natural roles even within the New Deal. Driving through
impoverished Southern counties, Paul Graves is told that “relief is in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
hands of the politicians and the politicians are mostly landlords who save
it for their own tenants.” Steinbeck’s Fruit Growers Association serves its
own interests in a more spectacular way. After an offer of twenty cents an
hour fails to satisfy the apple pickers, the fruit growers use strikebreakers,
vigilantes, sheriff’s deputies, and then troops to insure a harvest on their
terms.</p>

<p>It is curious that one of the American industrialists who approaches goodness
should be found in Sinclair’s <em>Oil!</em> As in his other novels, the industrialists
are the blackest of the black, but J. Arnold Ross is an exception. An
independent oil tycoon who conscientiously tries to see his workers’ point
of view, his rapacity is expressed in acquisition of oil lands by varied
methods rather than iron-handed labor relations. After his death it is discovered
that his business has deteriorated and his assets have melted, partly
because of the naval oil lands scandal. But there is also a missing bundle of
one million dollars, and at one point suspicion is cast upon his closest associate
and friend. The implied moral is probably that Ross’s few unsuppressed
humanitarian instincts rendered him less able to survive in this
particular jungle. The other sympathetically portrayed man of wealth in
this novel is Arnold’s son Bunny. Like Yevgeny Bazarov and his father
Vassily, these representatives of two generations are never quite able to
bridge the gap which separates them. Bunny loves his father, but his
symbolic rejection of him appears on page after page in which he almost
frantically disposes of his share of the oil money in subsidizing a leftist
paper or attempting to found a labor college. Sinclair’s Cagoulards in
<em>Presidential Agent</em> are quite willing to weaken France in order to retain
the Skoda munitions works. These Frenchmen are blood brothers of Malraux’s
Ferral, who does not see the consequences of his economic interpretation
of current history. The aristocrats and the wealthy are united in the
Thornewell family in <em>Boston</em>. Fighting on two fronts, they eliminate
anarchists and liquidate a parvenu entrepreneur in parallel actions. Sinclair’s
judgments of these representatives of the upper class are violent and condemnatory.
Sinclair’s condemnation is not quite typical of the political
novelists who treat the rich, although more of them approach his position
than Disraeli’s. When one compares the literary treatment of the lower
classes with that of the upper, the difference is striking. One might explain
this superficially on the grounds of distortion for dramatic emphasis, or the
use of ready-made heroes and villains. But whatever the reasons, the
majority of political novelists have been impelled to sympathize with the
lower classes and condemn the upper.</p>


<p class="p2 center big1">POLITICAL GROUPS</p>

<p>The second criterion for classifying political groups mentioned at the beginning
of this chapter was that of overt political behavior. The political
novel describes the behavior of the group to which its characters belong,
that group which, while seeking office or discharging it, conforms to a set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of rules both written and unwritten. From one point of view, these seem
almost like the rules for playing a game. From another point of view, they
are the principles which must be followed if what passes for success is to be
achieved. And these maxims are not merely empty phrases, for in the
novel the politicians who flaunt them fail. An oversimplified summary of
their content would be: follow party discipline regardless of any other
considerations; use any means likely to be effective to gain an advantage
over an opponent; follow political courses which are expedient rather than
exemplary. One of the most succinct statements of this attitude is made
by Senator Ratcliffe in Adams’s <em>Democracy</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If Washington were President now, he would have to learn our ways or lose
his next election. Only fools and theorists imagine that our society can be
handled with gloves or long poles.... If virtue won’t answer our purposes, we
must use vice, or our opponents will put us out of office....</p>
</div>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Office Holders: Rules and Skills</b></p>

<p>Trollope’s novels constitute an excellent primer for the politician.
Phineas Finn’s political eclipses are caused primarily by his persistent habit
of voting in accordance with his conscience rather than the Liberal Party
line. Edward Wilcher in <em>To Be a Pilgrim</em> takes what he believes will be a
vacation from politics after losing his seat in a close election. When he is
ready to return, he finds that his party will not have him. His brother Tom
reflects, “Perhaps they were always doubtful of him. They may have felt
that he wasn’t single-minded enough. They didn’t like his writing, especially
things like essays and criticism. Just as the Tories never liked Balfour’s
writing philosophy.” When Phineas Finn’s friend the Duke of Omnium
becomes Prime Minister, he permits himself the same luxury of being
impolitic. The death of the Marquis of Mount Fidgett gives him a chance
to award the Order of the Garter, normally given as a party spoil rather
than a tribute to merit. When Omnium bestows it upon the good, fuddled,
philanthropist Lord Earlybird, he nearly deals the deathstroke to his weakening
coalition. Mr. Daubeny, on the other hand, is a consummate artist at
the game of politics. Needing a vote of confidence to remain in office, he
conjures up a seemingly foolproof and completely hypocritical measure for
the test. As the head of the Tories, he introduces a bill for the disendowment
of the Established Church. He assumes that the Liberals will be
forced to vote for it as legislation they might themselves have proposed.
But the Liberals play the expedient game, too, with the result that the
Tories support what they are against to remain in office while the Liberals
oppose what they are for in order to turn the Tories out. In other novels
the conservatives also appear just as adept at rough and tumble politics as
their opponents. Lord Lostwithiel hires Tom Hannaway to bribe Hamer
Shawcross, who is standing for Parliament against Lord Lostwithiel’s son.
When the attempt fails, Tom defames Hamer by asserting that he has done
nothing for his mother even though he has had remarkable success.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Hamer’s counterstroke is to take the night train to Manchester, pluck his
mother from the happy home she shares with another widow, and exhibit
her at a rally the next day to refute the charge. The whole atmosphere of
English politics seems permeated by vigilance against quick marches. The
wife of a cabinet minister, Nina Nimmo remembers the constant intrigues
of groups within that small circle. Quite as wary are the rank and file of the
House:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everything they do is meant to have some effect beyond itself. Indeed many
... had got so plotty that everything that happened somewhere was “significant”
of some “development.” If you only asked them to take an ice, they looked at
you knowingly as if to ask themselves what you were “starting” and why.</p>
</div>

<p>The technique of buying off an opponent is more common in the American
political novel than in the English. But the attempt to purchase Jack
London’s Ernest Everhard is more subtle than that practiced on Hamer
Shawcross. Everhard is offered a job as United States Commissioner of
Labor. Even though this fee is more respectable than that offered Shawcross,
Everhard rejects the offer in order to retain his freedom of action.
The ways in which a political opponent can be embarrassed are legion.
When Paul L. Ford’s Peter Stirling is called out with his militia regiment
to protect six hundred strikebreakers, he is ordered to Grand Central Station,
the spot where it is most likely that the militia commander will be
forced to order his men to fire upon the strikers. Nick Galt in <em>The Voice of
the People</em> makes the Duke of Omnium’s error when he persists in making
political appointments on merit. He earns the name of “The Man with the
Conscience” but he loses important political support.</p>

<p>“Straws in the wind” may be a journalistic cliché, but the political novel
is littered with them. Like Nina Nimmo’s hyper-suspicious acquaintances,
they are another index of the complex behavior patterns of highly political
groups. The ability to sense the meaning behind occurrences which often
seem slight in themselves is another talent of the acute politician. When
Jethro Bass, in <em>Coniston</em>, learns that the postmastership of the small town
of Brampton is to go to another’s protégé, he realizes that this is the first
skirmish in a coming battle for control of the state. His riposte is to take
his candidate to Washington. An old soldier, he gains President Grant’s
sympathies and the job. The invocation of a dusty city ordinance which
pushes James L. Ford’s Hot Corn Ike and his iron kettle off the corner
traditionally marks the invasion of Mike Grogan’s ward by reform elements.
Willie Stark in <em>All the King’s Men</em> rightly interprets the attempt to
indict his state auditor as the first barrage in an attack against him by resurgent
opponents. In <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> the seemingly imminent
execution of Fabrizio del Dongo makes Parma’s incumbent regime totter.
The Archbishop is one of the very few acute enough to realize that “honour
forbade the Conte to remain Prime Minister in a country where they were
going to cut off the head, and without consulting him, of a young man who
was under his protection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Mechanics of Control</b></p>

<p>The mechanics by which power is attained and kept require mastery for
successful execution and close observation for understanding. Proficiency
in applying these techniques is as much the hallmark of the professional
political class as are the basic attitudes of the upper, middle, and lower economic
and social classes. If possible, an opponent is thrown off stride before
the race begins. Jerome Garwood in <em>The 13th District</em> feels that his renomination
to Congress is assured. But he is hurriedly called home to find
that control has been wrested from his chief supporter by an opponent who
has called an early district committee meeting after taking the precaution of
securing enough proxy votes to establish his supremacy. In <em>Number One</em>
Dos Passos had noted the importance of seating convention delegations
nine years before the celebrated controversies at the Republican national
convention of 1952. In this novel Chuck Crawford defeats a rival in seating
his delegation to the Democratic convention partly through the offices of
friends who have influence in the White House. Often the law is scrutinized
for advantages lying buried within it. Hank Martin in <em>A Lion Is in the
Streets</em> is swept into office on a tide of votes cast under his “God-blessed
Grandpappy Law.” Passed at the state’s 1898 disenfranchising convention,
the statute set up educational or property qualifications for voters but made
them inapplicable to descendants of men who had voted before 1868. Obtaining
photostats of the list of these men, he parcels them out as ancestors
to his illiterate followers who would otherwise be unable to vote. Counter-measures
against a dangerous opponent include the old dodge of conquering
through division. When in <em>All the King’s Men</em> the Harrison city forces
want to split the rural “cocklebur vote” of MacMurfee, they see to it that
Willie Stark enters the gubernatorial primary election. Of course, if one
has sufficient magnetism, he can charm and beguile an opponent out of his
path. In <em>The Grand Design</em> hopeful candidate Walker Watson returns
from dinner at the White House immensely pleased that the President
wants him to “take care of his health.” This solicitude takes the form of
advice for a rest on a ranch in Montana before the convention, “and particularly
no speeches.”</p>

<p>The mechanics of political success must of course be applied beyond
this highly technical behind-the-scenes area. President Roosevelt tells
Lanny Budd that he is moving toward alignment with the Allies as fast
as public opinion will allow him to go. In a less admirable concern for the
same force, Governor Fuller of Massachusetts had denied a last appeal by
Sacco and Vanzetti, according to Sinclair, because he wanted the job for
which Coolidge did not choose to run. A refinement and elaboration of this
technique is used by Senator O’Brien in <em>Stranger Come Home</em> when he
tries to time his committee’s most sensational charges to coincide with
press time for late newspaper editions.</p>

<p>The organization of political machines is also refined into a science,
particularly by people like Hank Martin in <em>A Lion Is in the Streets</em>, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
splits his domain into territories and keeps elaborate files, one on promising
opposition men who are to be destroyed politically. Methods designed to
insure conformity include devices such as the safe deposit boxes of Ben Erik
in <em>The City of Anger</em> which contain documentary evidence of the purchase
of key city officials. Nor is the psychology of interpersonal relationships
forgotten. Jethro Bass in <em>Coniston</em> always remains silent at the beginning
of an interview in order to force the other to speak first at a possible tactical
disadvantage. Even the protocol of visits is analyzed in <em>The Plum Tree</em> by
Harvey Sayler, who believes</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>there is no more important branch of the art of successful dealing with men than
the etiquette of who shall call upon whom. Many a man has in the very hour
of triumph ruined his cause with a blunder there&mdash;by going to see some one
whom he should have compelled to come to him, or by compelling some one
to come to him when he should have made the concession of going.</p>
</div>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>International Communism</b></p>

<p>Any discussion of group political behavior would be incomplete without
mentioning international Communism. Since Stalin’s ascendancy over
his domestic opponents in the late 1920s, the Communist movement has increasingly
become an instrument of Russian national policy rather than a
worldwide movement receiving help from the Soviets. Concomitantly,
Communism and Communists in England, the United States, Germany,
France, Greece, and China have much in common. An indication of the
way in which this force cuts across national lines is the fact that nearly a
quarter of all the novels in this study deal in varying degrees with Communism.
Even though the behavior of this group is theoretically based
upon reinterpreted Marxism, it contains definite patterns which relate to
Party discipline, strategy, and tactics which seem organizational rather than
ideological. One of the primary ones is the prohibition of original political
thought outside the limits laid down in the Kremlin. Deviationism is a
cardinal sin which destroys Nicolas Rubashov and endangers Rocco de
Donatis. In a pious attempt to avoid such error, Dr. Jane Sparling in <em>The
Grand Design</em> immediately consults Elmer Weeks, head of the American
Communist Party, to discover the proper attitude when Hitler invades
Russia. Another pattern is the interpretation&mdash;and use&mdash;of every action not
in terms of its immediate significance, but of its place in the overall plan.
The strikes of miners, apple-pickers, or pecan-shellers are not local disputes
between management and labor but battles in the class struggle to be used
to educate the masses and provide useful martyrs. But all the while, the
pretense that Communism is an international movement must be maintained.
In <em>Adventures of a Young Man</em> this view is purveyed to West Virginia
miners:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Less Minot got up and said that the American Miners was affiliated with organizations
all over the country that was working to overthrow the rotten
capitalistic system that kept the working class down to starvation wages with
guns and grafting officers of the law, and that if that was being a red, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
glad to be called a red, and as for the Rooshians, he didn’t know much about
them, but so far as he could hear tell the working class had overthrown its
capitalistic oppressors over there under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist
Communist Party and was running the country in their own interests and was
ready to help the workers in other countries to do the same.</p>
</div>

<p>In <em>Darkness at Noon</em> this diversion of Communism from the goal of
international revolution to the service of the Russian state is clothed in a
theory meant to make it both logical and necessary: when world revolution
did not follow the Russian Revolution, it was resolved that the primary
task was to preserve “the Bastion” in order to protect gains already made
and to maintain a base for later advances. Therefore in each country where
its activities are revealed, the Communist Party is found to act primarily
in the interests of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The use of racial minority groups has not been neglected by the Communists.
Several recent American novels have touched upon this subject.
The most vivid and powerful is Ralph Ellison’s <em>The Invisible Man</em> (1947).
The book’s nameless protagonist flees the South dogged by discrimination
and bad luck. He is drawn into The Brotherhood (a euphemism for
the Communist Party) and rises rapidly to become “Spokesman” for the
Harlem district. Despite appreciable gains he has made in membership,
the young Negro leader is shifted downtown. A bloody riot makes it clear
to him that the change in the Party line is deliberate. He finally understands
the full meaning of his ideological tutor’s words, “your members will
have to be sacrificed.” His break with the Party is basically the same as
Glenn Spotswood’s. But here the emotional involvement and subsequent
disillusionment are much greater. Farrell makes the same point in <em>Yet
Other Waters</em> through the speech of a Socialist Negro labor leader directed
at Communists who have come to disrupt a meeting. In a long passage
completely italicized for emphasis he says, “You are trying to manipulate
and betray my people. You are no friend of the black man or the white
man. You are the cancer of the working class. You are the architects of
defeat.”</p>

<p>War, no less than domestic conflict, is seen as an opportunity to extend
Communism which transcends the immediate national issues. The Spanish
Civil War was both a skirmish and a testing ground in which the full extent
of Russian intervention was concealed to prevent direct reprisals. In <em>The
Grand Design</em> Jed Farrington tells Georgia Washburn: “In the short term
war we’re allied to the Squire in the White House and his big business
friends but in the long-term war they are our most dangerous enemies.”
The subjugation of satellite party interests to Soviet interests is made clear
in <em>The Crack in the Column</em> by Moscow-trained Zachariades, who arrives
to deliver his post-mortem on the unsuccessful EAM uprisings: “Our
friends want no more premature, independent revolutions. They have
Italy and Palestine to think of.” Even the details of authorized revolutions
are foreseen and attended to. Leaders like Zachariades and Kyo Gisors in
<em>Man’s Fate</em> are made to order. Hemingway’s Robert Jordan reflects about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the Moscow-trained, bogus peasant leader of the Loyalists, Valentin
Gomez: “You had to have these peasant leaders quickly in this sort of
war.... You couldn’t wait for the real Peasant Leader to arrive and he
might have too many peasant characteristics when he did. So you had to
manufacture one.” These novels illustrate Communism’s diversity of character
and tactics and the rigid discipline it imposes upon its followers under
pain of expulsion or death.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Analysis of Mass Phenomena</b></p>

<p>Interest in mass political phenomena is sometimes expressed by these
authors not only through action, but in direct analysis and examination as
well. Steinbeck’s <em>In Dubious Battle</em> opposes two theorists: McLoed, who
thinks this particular strike is a good one because it will give him a chance
to “work out some ideas,” and Doc Burton, who serves as the strikers’ doctor
to observe contagion in the social body. Sounding more like a social
psychologist than a physician, he says</p>

<p class="blockquot">Group-men are always getting some kind of infection. This seems to be a bad
one. I want to see, Mac. I want to watch these group-men, for they seem to me
to be a new individual, not at all like single men. A man in a group isn’t himself
at all, he’s a cell in an organism that isn’t like him any more than the cells
in your body are like you.</p>

<p>Like Mac, Jim Nolan is a psychologist of mass violence. He even offers to
reopen his wound so that his blood will provide a stimulus for the group
to attack the strikebreakers. When the strikers are about to mob one strike
leader who has bloodied another, he diverts them from this assault to the
one he desires. There are other instances in which a specific theory of the
effects of violence is used for political purposes. Just as Dostoyevsky’s Pyotr
Verhovensky has his circle kill Shatov to cement them together, so Hemingway’s
Pablo had made his townsmen communal executioners of the Fascists:
“To save bullets,” explains Pilar, “and so that each man should have his
share in the responsibility.” The basic attitudes behind mass political
phenomena are analyzed by some of Koestler’s major characters. Both Jules
Commanche and Julien Dellatre discuss the ills of France and Western
man in general. Their conclusions are very similar to Rubashov’s critique
of Communist policy. Finally Koestler himself sums up this consistent
point of view when he explains the cause of Hydie’s constant and unsuccessful
search in <em>The Age of Longing</em>: “the place of God had become vacant,
and there was a draft blowing through the world as in an empty flat before
the new tenants have arrived.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >chapter six<br />
The Novelist as Analyst of Individual Political Behavior</h2>
</div>




<p>Repulsed by his party in his attempt to return to politics after the first
World War, Edward Wilcher, in <em>To Be a Pilgrim</em>, turns to writing. He
tells his brother:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No one has written a real political novel&mdash;giving the real feel of politics. The
French try to be funny or clever, and the English are too moral and abstract.
You don’t get the sense of real politics, of people feeling the way: of moles
digging frantically about to dodge some unknown noise overhead; of worms all
diving down simultaneously because of some change in the weather; or rising
up gaily again because some scientific gardener has spread the right poison
mixture; you don’t get the sense of limitation and confusion, of walking on a
slack wire over an unseen gulf by a succession of lightning flashes. Then the
ambitious side is always done so badly. Plenty of men in politics have no political
ambition; they want to defend something, to get some reform&mdash;it’s as simple as
that. But even then they are simple people, too, and it is the simple men who
complicate the situation. Yes, a real political novel would be worth doing. I
should like to do for politics what Tolstoy has done for war&mdash;show what a
muddle and confusion it is, and that it must always be a muddle and confusion
where good men are wasted and destroyed simply by luck as by a chance bullet.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps Edward’s insight into this aspect of politics has been sharpened
by the fact that, despite his immediate denial, he has been hit by just such
a bullet himself. But the impact must have been so great that it sent him
into a state of shock which made him unable to see that the novel had
done just what he said it hadn’t. The muddle and confusion are there, and
so are the men who rise above it as well as those who are sucked under
and lost.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Motivation</b></p>

<p>It is hard to draw the line between individual and group political behavior.
A man may be a mirror or conductor of political forces as well as a
discrete individual. His motivation is perhaps the most individual aspect
of his political experience. Most of the leading characters in these political
novels are strongly motivated. In only a few cases, such as that of Willis
Markham in <em>Revelry</em>, does the individual drift into politics. The ones who,
in Wilcher’s words, “want to defend something, to get some reform,” are
very common. The “something” that Robert Jordan wants to defend is
liberty in Spain, so that “there should be no more danger and so that the
country should be a good place to live in.” Lanny Budd feels exaltation that
in his role of Presidential Agent he is helping to defend democracy. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
reform that brings Millard Carroll to Washington is expressed in the aims
of the New Deal, and a similar response on a more emotional level is made
by Glenn Spotswood. Passing the shacks of the Mexican workers they have
tried to help, he exclaims, “By God, Jed, we’ve got to do something to
stop this kind of thing.”</p>

<p>A powerful motivating force which operates on a less conscious level
derives from a man’s being a bastard. Hamer Shawcross in <em>Fame Is the
Spur</em>, like Hyacinth Robinson in <em>The Princess Casamassima</em>, is illegitimate.
Both men are raised by people who try to give them the emotional security
of which their birth deprives them, but their attempts to change the
society into which they were born seem in part due to the feeling that they
are among its second-class citizens. Razumov in <em>Under Western Eyes</em> has
been raised, as far as the reader knows, without any family life at all. Yet
he is motivated in exactly the opposite direction from Shawcross and Robinson.
His assumption of a counter-revolutionary role is a direct result of his
feeling that his nation and its existing social fabric are all he has. He tells
the well-born revolutionary Haldin:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have no domestic tradition. I have nothing to think against. My tradition is
historical. What have I to look back to but that national past from which you
gentlemen want to wrench away your future?... You come from your province,
but all this land is mine&mdash;or I have nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>Generations later, another Russian reacts the same way under the new
regime. Feyda Nikitin in <em>The Age of Longing</em> has been orphaned by childbirth
and a counter-revolutionary firing squad. The last message from his
father’s eyes was one of “unshakable faith in the Great Change, and of
a childlike belief in the marvels and happiness which it would bring.” This
was enough to start Feyda on a career whose apex is the listing of Frenchmen
to be liquidated after Russian conquest.</p>

<p>The character of Feyda serves to bridge the gap between men like Shawcross,
Robinson, and Razumov and those who are motivated by a similar
but much more powerful force&mdash;spiritual bastardy. One of these is the
most demoniac of all Dostoyevsky’s possessed, Pyotr Verhovensky. He
publicly ridicules his father: “the man’s only seen me twice in his life and
then by accident.” It would be easy to make a case basing Pyotr’s anarchistic
politics upon a partial transference of his resentment of parental
rejection from old Stepan, his father, to Russia, his fatherland. Tony
Maggiore, the hero-villain of <em>Caesar’s Angel</em>, is called “the terrible child&mdash;the
child who had never known childhood.” Canon Borda’s analysis of
Fabrizio del Dongo’s violent behavior is also based upon childhood experiences:
“He is a younger son who feels himself wronged because he is
not the eldest.” There are also characters like Joe Yerkes in <em>The Grand
Design</em> who set out to change a society in which they feel at a social and
economic disadvantage. The houseboy and then protégé of a professor,
Yerkes is eventually led, chiefly by his feelings of inferiority and insecurity,
to join the Communist Party and to work at organizing auto workers. These
activities are a means, though never acknowledged, through which he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
try to change the existing society into one in which he will enjoy a higher
status and more prestige. In <em>The Secret Agent</em> the Professor’s failure in a
series of jobs had turned him into a revolutionary determined to destroy
the society which had rejected him. Jim Nolan had fought “the system”
as a lone, dispirited antagonist. The example of cell-mates had finally
channeled this antagonism into Communism, because “the hopelessness
wasn’t in them.... There was conviction that sooner or later they would
win their way out of the system they hated.” Some few individuals, like
Disraeli’s exemplary young men, enter politics out of a sense of <em>noblesse
oblige</em>. But more enter from a feeling of protest. Don Paolo’s reflections
in <em>Bread and Wine</em> emphasize the emotional nature of this motivation in
revolutionaries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He had once asked many militant members of his party what had led them to
Marxism, and nearly all of them had confessed that their original impulse, as in
his case, had been moral condemnation of existing society. He had read the
biographies of many revolutionaries, and he had never yet discovered anyone
who had become a revolutionary out of scientific conviction or economic calculation.</p>
</div>

<p>The pangs of unrequited love are partially responsible for Peter Stirling’s
dedication to success in politics in <em>The Honorable Peter Stirling</em>, just as
Frances Motherwell’s rejection by Vic Herres, in <em>The Troubled Air</em>, causes
her to denounce the Communist movement to which he is devoted. Other
motivating forces are just as conventional. Such dissimilar characters as
Fabrizio del Dongo in <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> and Jethro Bass in
<em>Coniston</em> are influenced by the career of Napoleon. The will to power as a
basic drive is more clearly put by Old Gisors in <em>Man’s Fate</em>: “every man
dreams of being god.” Mary McCarthy in <em>The Oasis</em> (1949) labels Will
Taub’s motivation as basically this when she says that “dreams of power
and mastery, far more than its fraternal aspect, were what had attracted him
to communism....” In some cases, like those of Silone’s heroes, the motivation
is quite complex. Don Nicola, in <em>A Handful of Blackberries</em>, says that
Rocco de Donatis “was the object of the clearest call from God that I have
ever witnessed.” Yet he had become a Communist and left the Church like
Pietro Spina in <em>Bread and Wine</em> “because of the profound disgust with
which he reacted to the abyss which he perceived between its practical
actions and the words it preached.” Even Spina’s name&mdash;literally “rock-thorn”&mdash;is
symbolic of the conflict between these forces within him. The
carpenter, merchant, clergyman, or teacher may drift into his vocation
through family pressure or pursuit of the line of least resistance. Almost
always the politician enters his because of a powerful driving force which
is just as likely to be subconscious as conscious.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Moral Problems and Changing Values</b></p>

<p>Another characteristic of the politician in the novel is the often-met
change in values. Basic to this process may be the frequency with which
he encounters moral problems. Some may be like Senator Ratcliffe in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
<em>Democracy</em>, whose “weakness ... lay in his blind ignorance of morals.”
But usually a choice must be made between that which is right and that
which is profitable. Sometimes it is as clear-cut as whether or not DeForest’s
John Vane should participate in the Great Subfluvial Tunnel Road (a
satire on the Crédit Mobilier) which is to run under the Mississippi and
unite Lake Superior and the Gulf of Mexico. Often the politician must
decide if he will check his conscience in the cloakroom while he votes on
a small issue in order to keep his party in power to attain larger ends.
Trollope’s heroes usually make the difficult but morally right decision, but
few applaud them. When Phineas Finn votes for the Irish Reform Bill,
Lord Tulla declares, “Very dirty conduct I think it was.... After being
put in for the borough twice, almost free of expense, it was very dirty.”</p>

<p>A symptom of changing values is the rejection of the constituency for
the capitol. Even the Duke of Omnium begins to abandon the idea of
retirement because “the poison of place and power and dignity had got
into his blood.” The career of Bradley Talcott in <em>A Spoil of Office</em> is a
classic example. He thinks of throwing up his political life until his renomination
is threatened. Then he finds that his office is the breath of life
in his nostrils. Jerome Garwood’s comment on returning to Washington
from campaigning in <em>The 13th District</em> is that “it’s worth all a fellow has
to go through out in that beastly mud hole to be back here where one can
really live.” This pattern is bound up, of course, with the problem of conformity.
In order to retain the prize, the politician must pay its price.
Hamer Shawcross puts the best possible interpretation upon his own behavior
when Pen Muff asks him why more can’t be done for the Welsh
miners. He replies that they will do as much as they can without running
the risk of being turned out of office:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I admit ... that it’s a matter of getting the most out of the second best. If all
things were working for the best&mdash;why, there’d be no need of politics at all,
Pen. I suppose the very word means not what we want but what is expedient.</p>
</div>

<p>The ultimate change in values, of course, is the sellout such as that of
which Shawcross and Nimmo are accused. There are cases too in which
the change takes the form not of deterioration but regeneration. Most of
these are found in vintage American novels, however, in which the love of
a good woman does the trick. Harvey Sayler, Jethro Bass, and Willis Markham
all reject the spoils of unsavory careers and don penitential garments
under this influence. The European treatment is much more subtle. In his
cell, Rubashov finds that his interior monologues are really dialogues,
“that there was a thoroughly tangible component in this first person singular,
which had remained silent through all these years and now had started
to speak.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Successful Politician</b></p>

<p>The individual who emerges most clearly from these novels is the successful
politician. One can even draw a complete profile of his characteristics.
And this composite illuminates not only the primary subject, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
also his counterpart. In the interplay between them one sees the essence
of that critical phenomenon, the leader-follower relationship. In <em>The Prime
Minister</em> Trollope ponders these subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If one were asked in these days what gift should a Prime Minister ask first from
the fairies, one would name the power of attracting personal friends. Eloquence,
if it be too easy, may become almost a curse. Patriotism is suspected, and sometimes
sinks almost to pedantry. A Jove-born intellect is hardly wanted, and
clashes with the inferiorities. Industry is exacting. Honesty is unpractical. Truth
is easily offended. Dignity will not bend. But the man who can be all things to
all men, who has ever a kind word to speak, a pleasant joke to crack, who can
forgive all sins, who is ever prepared for friend or foe but never very bitter to
the latter, who forgets not men’s names, and is always ready with little words,&mdash;he
is the man who will be supported at a crisis.... It is for him that men will
struggle, and talk, and if needs be, fight, as though the very existence of the
country depended on his political security.</p>
</div>

<p>The Duchess of Omnium’s discourse upon the tasks Omnium is unwilling
to perform is much more an indictment of politics in its worst sense than
this comparatively restrained analysis of Trollope’s. In much the same vein
Meredith’s Stukely Culbrett declares that Nevil Beauchamp has “too strong
a dose of fool’s honesty to succeed....” Hamer Shawcross’s own distillate
of thirty years of political experience is a bitter brew. Dissimulation is the
chief element in the formula for success. The politician must be an adept
psychologist appealing not to reason and intellect but to “panic, passion,
and prejudice.” Shawcross cynically adds that if these factors are not present
at the critical moment, the politician must know how to create them. The
lesson one learns from Chester Nimmo’s career is that the successful office
holder must be as agile as a gymnast, as flexible as a contortionist, and as
vigilant as a radar screen. In certain instances, the politician owes success
to what he does not do rather than to what he does. The ultimate in the
ossification of faculties whose exercise may be dangerous is reached by the
Communists. General Golz reveals his formula for survival to Robert Jordan:
“I never think at all. Why should I? I am General Sovietique. I never
think. Do not try to trap me into thinking.”</p>

<p>Peter Stirling’s list of requirements for political success is quite different.
Although he mentions physical superiority and dishonesty, his lecture
sounds like a naïve version of the Boy Scout oath. He mentions bosses, but
his account of the way he influences his constituents suggests Socratic dialogues
in Athenian meadows rather than politics in a tenement district of
downtown Manhattan. The physical characteristics which he mentions
briefly are noted by other authors, however. Nick Burr is a Virginia Lincoln
in appearance, while Senator Ratcliffe in <em>Democracy</em>, and Senator Planefield
in <em>Through One Administration</em>, represent the portly and impressive
type. Dan Lurcock’s acquisition of Willis Markham is based upon precisely
these qualities: “Let him get that magnificent head into the legislature,
where it would be on view, and there was nothing he might not do with it.”
This case appears to exaggerate the value of physical impressiveness, but
it illustrates the very real advantage which it confers upon its possessor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>The leader-follower relationship can depend in part upon just such
physical factors. Bill Dominick, who rules three congressional districts in
<em>The Plum Tree</em>, cows many of his supporters with his huge, ex-prizefighter’s
body. Jack London’s Ernest Everhard represents this type with the dross
transmuted to gold, for he is “a superman, a blond beast such as Nietzsche
has described.” Hank Martin combines this physical vitality with an oratorical
“kindlin’ power” which inspires his supporters. But his appeal is also
basic in another way. His theme “Divide the Riches” has an attraction for
impoverished back country people which is probably more compelling than
personal magnetism. The power of Michael J. Grogan in <em>Hot Corn Ike</em>
has a completely economic basis. From city departments and corporations
he obtains the green labor tickets which entitle their bearers to jobs. For
each ticket Grogan receives a vote. In <em>All the King’s Men</em>, Willie Stark’s
concern for his people’s welfare is also expressed in direct action, but he
explores psychological depths in his constituents unplumbed by other
politicians. He jeers at them as “suckers,” “red-necks,” and “hicks,” then
allies himself with them as one victimized by the same city politicians.
Losing his job because of these city bosses, he had become “symbolically
the spokesman for the tongue-tied population of honest men.” His oratory
is violent and emotional, full of questions which bring thunderous crowd
responses like those of a question-and-answer sermon in a revival meeting.
And he buttresses this primitive relationship with tangibles: an overloaded
state payroll, new highways, and a magnificent free hospital. But Willie
Stark’s appeal is not limited to the unlearned. The intelligent but neurotic
Jack Burden works for Willie even while he allows his critical faculties full
play. Anne Stanton, a governor’s daughter, becomes Willie’s mistress. Both
of these people see in Willie strength where they are weak. To Jack he
is a man who lives in and for the present; to Anne he is an embodiment of
strength, a man who knows precisely what he wants and is willing to pay
the price to get it. Another practitioner of psychology is Councilor Mikulin
in <em>Under Western Eyes</em>. He enlists Razumov in his service through his
faculty for sensing each man’s vulnerability. “It did not matter to him
what it was&mdash;vanity, despair, love, hate, greed, intelligent pride, or stupid
conceit&mdash;it was all one to him as long as the man could be made to serve.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Political Pathology: Deviates, Martyrs, and Authoritarians</b></p>

<p>This topic leads directly to a very curious set of political phenomena. It
can be described as political pathology. The line between sanity and madness
is just as hazy here as it is in other areas. But one can usually distinguish
between one man who is intelligently dedicated to a goal and
another who is a fanatic. Dostoyevsky intended that all his revolutionaries
should represent very dangerous forms of madness. It is obvious that Kirillov,
who believes he can become God by killing himself, is insane. The
drunken brute Lebyadkin, like the vicious Pyotr, idolizes Stavrogin as a
god, while Stavrogin himself is a complete masochist. Erkel is described
as a fanatic who can serve a cause only through one person seen as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
expression of it. Shatov recognizes their abnormality. He tells the narrator
that they would be lost if Russia were suddenly transformed: “They’d have
no one to hate then, no one to curse, nothing to find fault with. There’s
nothing in it but an immense animal hatred for Russia which has eaten
into their organism.” Even more lethal a fanatic is the terrorist Ch’en Ta
Erh in <em>Man’s Fate</em>. He nerves himself for his first act of violence in the
novel by driving a dagger point into his arm. Later, in a state of exaltation,
he stabs a fragment of glass into his thigh to express to his companions the
intensity he feels as he proposes that they should throw themselves with
their bombs beneath Chiang Kai-shek’s car. Ch’en develops an almost
mystical attraction toward death which he finally satisfies by shooting himself
when the attempt on Chiang’s life fails. His opposite number is Konig,
chief of Chiang’s police. Once tortured by the Communists, he declares
“My dignity is to kill them.... I live ... only when I’m killing them.”
Several of Conrad’s characters, notably Nikita the assassin in <em>Under Western
Eyes</em> and the Professor in <em>The Secret Agent</em>, are quite as ready to kill
for political reasons. Warren’s Willie Stark has a fanatical bodyguard in
Sugar-Boy, a stuttering gnome of a man who combines absolute devotion
to Stark with the satisfaction he gets from driving a high-powered car and
using a .38 Special revolver.</p>

<p>But the fanatic need not engage in violence. He appears to channel his
drives into actions appropriate to the political framework within which he
operates. In <em>The Troubled Air</em> Communist Vic Herres calculatedly ruins his
old friend Clement Archer. “Because he’s a fanatic,” explains Vic’s wife
Nancy, “because he would sacrifice me and Johnny and young Clem and
himself and anybody else if he was told it was for the cause....” The
political novel also contains examples of the Communist who carries his
fanaticism intact with him in his journey from the extreme Left to the far
Right. Elsie McCabe and Frederick Newman knowingly perjure themselves
before Senator O’Brien’s committee in <em>Stranger Come Home</em>. And
it is clear that they have made their allegations against Whitehead with the
same disregard for truth which they found useful in their years as Party
members. Another of the same species as Dostoyevsky’s Erkel and Warren’s
Sugar-Boy is Spring’s Jimmy Newboult. “Knighted” by Shawcross
with the Peterloo sabre, he precedes him into each rally carrying it aloft.
But with his scruples and acute moral sense, Jimmy represents a mid-point
between the deadly Ch’en and Marion Crawford’s sugar-and-spice fanatic.
Crawford explains noble John Harrington’s lack of zeal in proposing to
pining Josephine Thorn in <em>An American Politician</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was a man, she said, who loved an unattainable, fanatic idea in the first place,
and who dearly loved himself as well for his own fanaticism’s sake. He was a
man in whom the heart was crushed, even annihilated, by his intellect, which he
valued far too highly, and by his vanity, which he dignified into a philosophy of
self-sacrifice.</p>
</div>

<p>In <em>Bread and Wine</em> Luigi Murica tells Pietro Spina, “I decided that
politics was grotesque&mdash;nothing but an artificial struggle between rival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
degenerates.” His comment may be taken literally as well as figuratively, for
political and sexual pathology are combined in the cases of the deviates
in these novels. There are enough to fill a textbook of abnormal psychology.
The most common is the homosexual who often seeks to achieve through
political association the sense of acceptance by his fellows which he feels
is denied him by his maladjustment. Such a one is Marcello Clerici in <em>The
Conformist</em>. Moravia’s detailed treatment virtually gives a case history
following a familiar pattern. Marcello’s feeling of abnormality is deepened
by a childhood traumatic experience in which he barely escapes assault by
a middle-aged man. Marcello marries, but he remains a latent homosexual
throughout his life, feeling a frightening desire to submit when he is
accosted by an old man in a situation very like the first one. He hopes to
achieve conformity through marriage and membership in the Fascist Party.
After paving the way for the political murder of a former teacher, he reflects
that the success of the regime is needful to him psychologically. “Only in
that way,” he thinks, “could what was normally considered an ordinary
crime become, instead, a positive step in a necessary direction.” This maladjustment
is found on many levels, from that of Communist General
Ares in <em>The Crack in the Column</em> to post-adolescent Winthrop Strang in
<em>The Grand Design</em>. The son of a famous author now deceased, Strang
petulantly complains that he is not receiving enough attention from his
dominating mother, a well-known newspaper columnist. In what appears
to be an attempt to obtain this affection from other sources, he has thrown
himself into Communist Party work and an affair with young Mervyn
Packett, another Party member who writes for the Negro press. Lee Sarason,
who succeeds Buzz Windrip as American dictator in <em>It Can’t Happen
Here</em>, surrounds himself with strong young members of the Minute Men:
“He was either angry with his young friends, and then he whipped them,
or he was in a paroxysm of apology to them, and caressed their wounds.”
The parallel between Sarason and Nazi Ernst Röhm is completed when he
is shot late at night by another American Nazi, Colonel Dewey Haik.
Several brusque and mannish women appear in these novels. Lannie Madison
in <em>Barbary Shore</em> is a lesbian who has denied herself everything, including
love, to work for the Communist Party. Having broken with it, she
is now a completely disorganized personality.</p>

<p>One of the most complex deviates is Dostoyevsky’s Nikolay Stavrogin.
Although he is capable of heterosexual relationships, he is a pervert who
has corrupted a small child and caused her suicide. A sadist, he is also an
admitted masochist. In marrying the feeble-minded Marya Lebyadkin he
had carried out his idea of “somehow crippling my life in the most repulsive
manner possible.” In the long-suppressed chapter of the novel which contains
his confession to Bishop Tihon, Stavrogin hears the Bishop tell him:
“You are possessed by a desire for martyrdom....” But the “terrible undisguised
need of punishment” is emotionally complicated because this
compulsion is a “need of the cross in a man who doesn’t believe in the
cross&mdash;” Stavrogin plays an essentially passive political role since he allows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
himself to be used by Pyotr. His case represents, however, a combining of
abnormalities usually found singly.</p>

<p>One aspect of Stavrogin’s character also appears in men who do not
deviate from the norm. Nick Burr in <em>The Voice of the People</em> looks like
Lincoln in his towering stature and his “good, strong kind of ugliness.” He
prepares himself for his martyrdom by opposing powerful forces in his state,
and finally meets it by attempting to halt a lynching. To some, this self-sacrifice
carries an almost religious ecstasy. In Moravia’s <em>The Fancy Dress
Party</em> Saverio has been ordered to assassinate the dictator of the South
American country of Bolivar. He thinks that he now knows what the early
Christians must have felt, “the sweet, deep pleasure of sacrificing themselves
for the greater good of humanity....” Shaw’s Clement Archer and
Shirer’s Raymond Whitehead do not enter into their ordeals with the intention
of becoming martyrs. When they are deprived of their primary
sources of livelihood, however, this is precisely what they become. In most
of the novels there is an awareness of the political value of martyrs, and
the Communists, particularly, excel in their manufacture.</p>

<p>If frequency of occurrence were used to determine whether or not a
phenomenon is abnormal, perhaps the dictator would have to be classed
as normal. Within political systems embodying the principles of representative
government, however, he represents a disease just as surely as a group
of cells which suddenly start overwhelming their neighbors. The novel
displays not only fictitious tyrants, but real ones as well, from Caesar in
Wilder’s <em>The Ides of March</em> (1948) to Koestler’s thinly disguised Stalin in
<em>Darkness at Noon</em>. The authors usually describe how they act and what
made them that way. Since <em>The Ides of March</em> uses the diaries and letters
of several Roman citizens, the reader learns precisely what Caesar’s contemporaries
thought of him and what Caesar thought of himself. In the
accounts of his enemies, he is a profligate and pervert, a destroyer of liberty.
His own writings reveal him as a man who is cold and self-centered but
devoted to Rome and possessed of amazingly catholic and intelligent interests.
Trying to free his countrymen from superstition, mythology, and
barbarism, he rationalizes his dictatorship on the basis that the people will
not assume the duties of self-government. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But there is no liberty save in responsibility. That I cannot rob them of because
they have not got it.... The Romans have become skilled in the subtle resources
for avoiding the commitment and the price of political freedom. They
have become parasites upon that freedom which I gladly exercise&mdash;my willingness
to arrive at a decision and sustain it&mdash;and which I am willing to share with
every man who will assume its burden.</p>
</div>

<p>Like Caesar, most authoritarian rulers appear to believe that they are working
in the best interests of their people. Most often this is a rationalization
of an enormous drive to personal power, but whatever its source it is almost
always a component of the totalitarian mentality. Some absolutists, like
Stendhal’s Ernesto IV of Parma, make no pretense of extraordinary concern
for their subjects. But the modern pattern is for the Duce, Führer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
or Father of the People to associate himself with the masses, at least verbally.
This is as true of state dictators such as Chuck Crawford, Hank
Martin, and Willie Stark as it is of General Arango in <em>The Fancy Dress
Party</em>. The three Americans also have in common their origins as members
of the lower or lower middle class of southern whites. Each starts with a
seemingly genuine desire to better the lot of his group. Their careers provide
a study of the same infection which attacks the Duke of Omnium,
“the poison of place and power and dignity.” And this transition from
crusader to sick man gives insight into the process by which dictators are
made.</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>Men Behind the Scenes</b></p>

<p>Another political type which is not quite pathological yet which occupies
a position somewhat outside the main stream of normal political activity
is that of the silent man, the one who often wields great power but remains
nearly concealed from the public. He is found most often in American
politics. Major Rann, boss of the Virginia Senate and opponent of Nick
Burr in Ellen Glasgow’s <em>The Voice of the People</em>, “had never made a
speech in his life, but ... he was continually speaking through the mouths
of others.” Jethro Bass in <em>Coniston</em> is another silent man, figuratively and
literally. This type carried to the extreme is Dan Lurcock in <em>Revelry</em>,
President-maker, interstate lobbyist, and national salesman of patronage.
A European variant of this type is represented by Karl Yundt in <em>The Secret
Agent</em>. Described as “no man of action,” his function is to goad others
into action. This catalytic role is performed by anti-fascist Professor Quadri
in <em>The Conformist</em>. His specialty is proselytizing the young. Cold and detached,
he often channels his converts into actions he knows will be fatal,
“desperate actions that could be justified only as part of an extremely long-term
plan and that, indeed, necessarily involved a cruel indifference to the
value of human life.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Disillusioned</b></p>

<p>In <em>The Age of Longing</em> ex-Marxist poet Julien Dellatre asks Hydie Anderson:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do you remember ‘The Possessed’? They were an enviable crowd of maniacs.
We are the dispossessed&mdash;the dispossessed of faith; the physically or spiritually
homeless. A burning fanatic is dangerous; a burnt-out fanatic is abject.</p>
</div>

<p>With these words he speaks for a constantly growing number of former
political enthusiasts who have discovered that they had carried not a torch
but a club. One is tempted to call this era the Age of Disillusionment. But
this would in a sense be an error, for disillusionment is as old as politics.
It is always present; only the number of cases varies. The literary list is a
long one&mdash;Phineas Finn, the Duke of Omnium, Dick Remington, Hilary
Vane, Harvey Sayler, Glenn Spotswood, and scores of others. Even the
opportunist Shawcross is not immune. Near the end of his career he asks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
himself if statesmen are not actually “the true pests and cancers of human
society.” He thinks that if he could have one wish granted, it would be
that politicians would leave all the people alone for fifty years. “We might
then have a better world,” he reflects. “We couldn’t have a worse one.”</p>

<p>The modern literature of disillusionment introduces a variation on this
old theme. The discontent is localized to one ideology&mdash;Communism. Mary
McCarthy states one of its basic causes in <em>The Oasis</em> when she says that
Will Taub’s “disillusionment with the Movement had sprung largely from
its concentration on narrowly nationalistic aims and its abandonment of
an insurgent ideology.” In its original use, the term “literature of disillusionment”
referred primarily to the body of work of a group of writers who
had turned away from Communism. But for the purposes of this study it is
just as fruitful to focus on the creations rather than their authors. The
best of these novels is unquestionably Koestler’s <em>Darkness at Noon</em>. It is
outstanding not only as a psychological portrait in depth, but also as an
interpretation of an important phenomenon. Rubashov is at once an individual
and a mirror of forces at work in modern international politics.
His journey has taken him from exalted participation in revolution, through
consolidation of its gains, to a final questioning of the worth of the whole
agonizing process. But his life has been bound up so completely with the
cause that even his final renunciation is tinged with haunting doubt. Lying
in his cell, one of the last survivors of the old guard, he is unable to repress
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The horror which No. 1 emanated, above all consisted in the possibility that
he was in the right, and that all those whom he had killed had to admit, even
with the bullet in the back of their necks, that he conceivably might be in the
right.</p>
</div>

<p>Rubashov’s disillusionment springs from the fact that the light has gone
out of the revolutionary movement, that what was to become a new paradise
has become an old hell. The dictatorship of the proletariat has evolved
into the tyranny of No. 1; the new man has grown into a Neanderthaler.
Instead of a promised land, Rubashov has returned from his foreign assignments
to find a country where factory workers are shot as saboteurs for
negligence caused by fatigue. His conclusion that the regime’s error was
caused by abandonment of ethical standards is central to the <em>bouleversement</em>
he undergoes. But even despite this basic departure from Communist
thought, it is important to recognize that he is still a Marxist. He even
elaborates the old dialectic in prison with his “theory of the relative
maturity of the masses.” His participation in his mock trial emphasizes
the ambivalence he feels. One passage explains this behavior and that of
some of the men to whom Koestler dedicated the novel:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The best of them kept silent to do a last service to the Party, by letting themselves
be sacrificed as scapegoats&mdash;and, besides, even the best had each an Arlova
on his conscience. They were too deeply entangled in their own past, caught in
the web they had spun themselves, according to the laws of their own twisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
ethics and twisted logic; they were all guilty, although not of those deeds of
which they accused themselves. There was no way back for them. Their exit
from the stage happened strictly according to the rules of their strange game.
The public expected no swan-song of them. They had to act according to the
textbook, and their part was the howling of wolves in the night....</p>
</div>

<p>Where there is freedom of choice, the disillusioned one follows one of
three courses: needing an outlet for the forces which originally took him
to the Party, he engages in leftist, non-Stalinist activity; ricocheting violently
in the opposite direction, he aligns himself with the extreme Right;
or exhausted, he sinks into a melancholy, nostalgia-tinged apathy. Rocco de
Donatis throws himself into the struggle of the peasants for land. Frederick
Wellman and Elsie McCabe lie with virtuosity in the service of Senator
O’Brien. Lannie Madison retreats into neurosis. The causes of the disenchantment
vary. Glenn Spotswood makes his break because he is interested
in men as men rather than as pawns in a game. Rocco’s point of
departure is the discovery of Siberian labor camps. Both of them, however,
suffer somewhat the same aftereffects. There is a feeling of loss, the sensation
that a platform has been knocked out from under them.</p>

<p>This particular reaction is best portrayed through the creative artists who
appear in these novels. Julien Dellatre is one of three ex-Communists who
call themselves the Three Ravens Nevermore. A scarred veteran of the
Spanish Civil War, he refers to his poems, “Ode to the Cheka,” “Elegy on
the Death of a Tractor,” and “The Rape of Surplus Value” as “past asininities.”
His renunciation of the Movement is complete, yet his tragedy
lies in the fact that he has found nothing to replace it. He has concluded
that “Europe is going to the dogs,” that the reason is a turning away from
God, a “loss of cosmic consciousness.” Feeling that a new religion is
necessary to save twentieth-century man, he lacks a conviction which
would permit him to take the final step into faith. The great passion of his
life is behind him. In his own comment he has summed himself up: “a
burnt-out fanatic is abject.” Another man of letters in the same novel is
Leo Leontiev, “Hero of Culture and Joy of the People,” who has come
from Russia to France to address an international peace rally. The death
of his wife frees him to renounce the regime and find political asylum in
France. Psychologically ready to take this step, “he felt as if a whole drugstore
of poison were working at [his synapses]&mdash;the accumulated toxins of
thirty years.” He has become a Hero of Culture by following the Party line
in literature rather than his artistic conscience. Free at last, he feels that
he must write something truly fine, a vindication of himself that will also
be worthy of his wife, whose death he suspects may have been suicide or
murder. But he is unable even to write the projected <em>I Was a Hero of
Culture</em> for the American publisher who has given him a substantial advance.
For him, as for Dellatre, the light had flickered out, and it could not
be rekindled.</p>

<p>Some artists, like novelist Bernard Carr and poet Lester Owens in <em>Yet
Other Waters</em> manage to rebound, to continue to work creatively. But still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
they bear psychological scar tissue. Even in the process of preparing to
leave the Movement, Bernard Carr suggests from the floor that the Writers
Congress be concluded with the singing of “The Internationale.” And he
is moved as he sings. An allied phenomenon is that of the individual who
is inwardly in conflict with the Party but remains with it through a fear
of these consequences. When Bernard tells frustrated poet Sam Leventhal
that he should leave the Party, Sam turns pale. “Bernie, the Party is my
life,” he replies. “It would be spiritual death for me outside the Party.”
An even more revealing answer is made by British physicist Lord Edwards.
When Leontiev asks him why he stays, Edwards replies: “I told you there
is nothing else. You will soon find that out yourself. Besides&mdash;once you’ve
invested all your capital in a firm, you don’t withdraw it&mdash;not at our age,
not after thirty years.”</p>


<p class="big1 p2 "><b>The Role of Woman</b></p>

<p>When women engage in political activity in these novels they are usually
cast in one of four roles: man’s guide, the reformer, the dedicated Communist,
or the patriot. In the years before suffrage was extended to women,
one of the few opportunities afforded them for engaging in political activity
was to influence or guide a man who was politically active. Emily Harkness
performs this function for Jerome Garwood in <em>The 13th District</em>. At the
beginning of his career he is her intellectual protégé as she channels his
reading and thinking. His rejection of this relationship is coupled with his
political degeneration and ruin. In <em>Hot Corn Ike</em> Molly McMurdo counsels
Mike Grogan with acuteness and insight. Since she is a procuress, she supplies
very little moral guidance, but her analyses of the factors at work in
the district are penetrating if not intellectual. Peter Ivanovitch, leader of the
Geneva revolutionary circle in <em>Under Western Eyes</em>, preaches the cult of
woman as well as revolution. He had been aided by a woman in making his
legendary escape across Siberia. The devotion he felt toward her is also
bestowed upon Madame de S&mdash;&mdash;, who contributes not only inspiration
but also her chateau to Peter’s activities. Fancying herself another Madame
de Staël, this “Egeria of the ‘Russian Mazzini’” appears more like a witch
than a prophetess. Possessed of a garishly painted, mask-like face whose outstanding
features are extraordinarily brilliant eyes and obviously false teeth,
she contributes to one conversation by screaming that they must “spiritualize
the discontent.”</p>

<p>The intellectual guide of man par excellence is Ida Wilbur in <em>A Spoil of
Office</em>. She remains stolid Bradley Talcott’s ideal and teacher even after he
has attained the House of Representatives. But she is also an active field
worker for the farmers. A pamphleteer and lecturer, she represents the
woman reformer who enters into direct action rather than stand once removed
from activity. Mrs. Ward’s Marcella acts for herself, but to a lesser
degree than DeForest’s Squire Nancy Appleyard and Spring’s three
feminists&mdash;Lizzie Lightowler, Anne Shawcross, and Pen Muff. Lawyer
Nancy Appleyard is a ridiculous figure with her trousers and pistols, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
her feminist agitation she is a precursor of the others. These women are distinguished
by conviction, perseverance, and willingness to engage in violent
action under pain of brutality and imprisonment to attain their goals.</p>

<p>In strong contrast to Madame de S&mdash;&mdash; in <em>Under Western Eyes</em> is
Sophia Antonovna, an influential veteran revolutionary. A striking woman
with her gray-white hair and bright red blouse, she is “the true spirit of
destructive revolution.” Shawcross’s daughter-in-law Alice is a direct descendant
of Sophia Antonovna. Shortly after her return from Moscow, a
letter is published addressed by Zinoviev to the Communists of Britain
urging uprisings in the Army and Navy. Implying that Ramsay MacDonald
had been pushed into treaties with Russia by Communist pressure, it helps
cause the fall of his government. Noting the time of Alice’s visit and the
intensity of her devotion to Communism, Shawcross suspects that she had
helped Zinoviev to plan and write the letter. Dos Passos’ militant women
Communists such as Jane Sparling throw themselves into Party activities
almost more zealously than the men. One of the women in <em>Yet Other
Waters</em> might be listed under political pathology as well as here. She is
Alice Robertson, a nymphomaniac and frustrated novelist whose regard for
her current lover does not prevent her from reporting on him to the Party.</p>

<p>There is no Joan of Arc in these political novels, but in Hemingway’s
book one hears about the fiery La Pasionaria, and in <em>The Age of Longing</em>
and <em>Nostromo</em> the actions of two women evoke mention of the name of
Charlotte Corday. In Conrad’s novel Antonia Avellanos is as fierce a
patriot as her father Don José, who had nearly died in inhuman captivity
by dictator Guzmán Bento. Her fierce anger against General Montero, a
modern Bento, is one of the forces which brings cynical dilettante Don
Martin Decoud to throw himself into the struggle which leads to his death.
She suggests Charlotte Corday to him, as does Hydie Anderson indirectly
to Jules Commanche when she asks that Feyda Nikitin be expelled from
France. But Hydie’s patriotism does not have the fire of Antonia’s. She has
come to recognize Feyda’s brutality and immorality, but the immediate
cause of her action is his humiliation of her which breaks off their affair.
This gesture is the first positive one she has made. Up to this point she has
seemed about to apply for membership in the Ravens Nevermore. Her
disillusionment, like theirs, has come from rejection of a strong and disciplined
system which answered all her questions and assuaged all her doubts.
Her break with the Roman Catholic Church has left her quite as adrift as
Dellatre or his companions. And when her gesture fails, she feels herself
slipping back into the old despondency, the craving for sureness, for a set
of positive values.</p>

<p>Although treated in lesser detail than the men (except for Hydie), these
women offer the reader the same opportunity for intimate acquaintance
with people who can become more real than those one meets on the street
or in the office. Their reality and complexity vary with the skill of their
creators, but one is able to follow their actions and thoughts more closely
than those of individuals in “real life.”</p>

Some Conclusions</h2>
</div>



<p>In some areas of this study only the main outlines have been sketched
in. Good books have probably been omitted, particularly in European
literatures. Some mediocre ones, especially American novels, have been
included. This was done to give some idea of the development of this form
in the United States, but with the fervent hope that a gain in historical
continuity would not produce too great a loss through exclusion of more
quality. But if a few major points have emerged, this study has fulfilled its
purpose.</p>

<p>The press has always been acknowledged as a major factor in influencing
political opinion. A close look at the phenomenal success of <em>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</em> reveals that the right novel appearing at the critical time can exercise
wide and lasting influence. With his freedom to place a quarter of a
million words between two covers, the novelist can present more information
and achieve more reader involvement than any newspaper using
columns of factual accounts, brilliant editorials, and four-color Sunday
supplements. The novelist can vie with Gibbon and Macaulay if he chooses,
ranging freely from century to century, turning from Caesar to modern
man, or from Machiavelli to a politician of the twenty-sixth century. Just
as the writer treats the rise and decline of empires, so he portrays the flowering
and withering of movement. Evoking the past, the novelist can people
it with living beings and bring to life its tensions, its climaxes, its meanings.
One can gain some understanding of the factors which make men like one
another despite national and cultural factors which differentiate them.
Silone’s peasants, like Garland’s farmers, crave enough to keep them sheltered
and fed, to give them the feeling that they can work in peace with a
feeling of security. One senses differences, however, in political hierarchies.
The Prime Ministers of Disraeli and Trollope are masters, but the Presidents
of Adams and Ford are badgered servants. There are insights into the
small niceties, the little peculiarities that distinguish varying political usages.
The American politician’s life is exposed to glaring publicity, but the Englishman
is spared unless he is brought to court. In <em>To Be a Pilgrim</em> Tom
Wilcher notes that “Gladstone’s missing finger appeared in all caricatures,”
but “the newspapers never referred to the continuous drunkenness of
Mr. A., a cabinet minister, or to even more scandalous liaisons than Edward’s.”</p>

<p>The novelist is able to hold his subject close or at a distance, and to examine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
it from any point of the compass. He can slice through the body
politic and peel back its layers, stopping to scrutinize the one that interests
him. He can follow the early struggles that preceded the English Labourites’
rise to power or trace the collateral decline of the Liberals. Even in his
treatment of individuals, he can provide a sense of continuity with men of
antiquity by presenting modern Caesars. They may dress differently, talk
differently, and get their death wounds with bullets rather than daggers.
But they are members of the same tradition, followers of the same principles
of political action. Nor is the new man neglected. In a sense,
Rubashov, with his gnawing conflicts, is as much a new type as is Gletkin
with his mentality which precludes conflict. And, of course, one gets much
more than history. Tourgée interlards the Reconstruction story in <em>Bricks
Without Straw</em> with analyses of causative factors. In a long passage he
elaborates his theory that “the town-meeting&mdash;the township system or its
equivalent&mdash;in the North and South, constituted a difference not less vital
and important than that of slavery itself.” Generally the European novelist
places more stress upon theory than does the American, but in each literature
close examination of causes is hardly ever excluded by concentration
upon effects.</p>

<p>The political novel has a well demonstrated vitality as a literary form.
The indications are that it will continue to grow. At the same time it will
probably display a continuity in the phenomena and ideas it treats. The
political novel will continue to chronicle movements. Just as Dostoyevsky
and Conrad dealt with Communism’s origins and Koestler and Silone with
its schisms and apostates, so other authors will follow its eventual destiny.
The minutiae of political experience will provide material just as much as
the major facets. One example is the “whitewash,” the investigation which
begins with grim determination and implacable intent only to end with
confusing or ineffectual conclusions. Such investigations are directed toward
election frauds in <em>Phineas Redux</em>, the Great Subfluvial Tunnel Road in
<em>Honest John Vane</em>, and oil lease scandals in <em>Revelry</em>. It is also likely that
the political novel will treat a wider variety of subjects. Some of the attention
which corruption has received, particularly in the American novel, may
well be directed toward other aspects of the political process which have so
far been explored little or not at all. The love story or love interest will continue
to parallel the political story. But there will probably be more novels
in which the relationship will be symptomatic of the same drives or needs
operative in the political sphere. This is the sort of treatment given the
relationship between Hydie and Feyda in <em>The Age of Longing</em>. If one interprets
the word “love” loosely, this approach may be seen in the description
of Nikolay and Marya in <em>The Possessed</em>. The latter novel and <em>The Conformist</em>
will be followed by more novels in which the author concentrates
upon intensive psychological studies of individuals representative of particular
political mentalities or groups.</p>

<p>The novel set in the future will probably retain the vitality displayed by
such books from the time of Edward Bellamy’s <em>Looking Backward</em> (1888)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
to Orwell’s <em>1984</em>. It is in this area that science fiction may make a contribution
to the political novel. Jules Verne’s novels were science fiction, but in
the society in which he wrote, his work was likely to remain fiction for some
time. Modern technology makes it possible for the best science fiction to
achieve a greater relevance, to present what may shortly be fact. The world
of the future in modern novels tends more often to be a hell than a utopia.
And the space ships, robots, and other electronic devices emphasize the
godless, mechanistic aspect of modern society which writers like Orwell
and Koestler see in it. The better writers of science fiction use this technique.
Ray Bradbury’s <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> (1953), perhaps the best of these
novels, portrays a post-atomic war America two decades hence in which
technology has been used to kill freedom and make its subjects love their
bondage. Guy Montag’s revolt against his role in this society may not be
completely believable, but Bradbury’s three-wall television sets and book-burning
fire brigades bring home the horror of a possible totalitarian society
of the future with an impact matched only by Orwell’s telescreens and
Ministry of Love.</p>

<p>The future should bring more political novels than the past because this
age is so permeated with politics. The Napoleonic era and the late nineteenth
century may have been just as political in their ways as this one, but
with modern mass communication media, more people are now involved
in and aware of politics than ever before. And, of course, politics has become
more complex, more in need of interpretation than ever before. Only
a relatively small number of Disraeli’s and Trollope’s novels concentrate on
politics. By contrast, most of the output of Koestler and Silone lies within
this field. Each good novelist, no matter what his age, finds the particular
subject matter which allows his talents freest range. But his material is life,
unless, like James Branch Cabell and others, he creates a reflection of life
in a special land of his own which never was in time or space. But as life
grows more political the novelist must inevitably reflect this fact, even if
only casually.</p>

<p>All this means that the reader who wants to learn about political phenomena
from the novel will have a greater mass of material to work with
than ever. Overall quality will be at least as good as it has been and probably
better as proportionately more good novelists work in this genre. All
of the fictional histories, analyses, and interpretations will require the same
reader value-judgments as ever. Prejudice will still intrude; partisanship
will still distort. But these same judgments are necessary, in a measure,
when the reader picks up the book of a historian or a political scientist.
And the novelist may use all of the tools in their workrooms while he adds
to them his own resources&mdash;imagination, dramatic form, and the freedom
and scope given him by the versatile art of fiction.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
